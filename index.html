    <h1>Through and beyond an Actor-Network Theory (ANT) lens</h1>
    <p>This website is under construction.</p>
    <p>It will be about my doctoral thesis in Digital Humanities titled <i>Linked Open Usable Data standards for Citizen Science: perspectives on Interoperability and Knowledge Representation through and beyond an Actor-Network Theory lens</i> (working tile) which is undertaken at the University of Basel in the context of the <a href="https://about.participatory-archives.ch/" target="_blank">Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives</a> (PIA) research project.</p>
    <p>The idea is to keep four digital notebooks (here named "log, cards, Ad libitum and effects") as hinted by Bruno Latour in his 2005 book <i>Reassembling the Social</i> ("Back to basics: a list of notebooks" - pp. 133-135).</p>
