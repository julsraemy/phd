      "content_html": "LOUD for Cultural Heritage – PhD Thesis by Julien A. Raemy “Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) for Cultural Heritage&quot; not only encapsulates the essence of my PhD thesis, but also reflects a passion, as I have been actively involved in both the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) and the Linked Art communities for many years. It describes a vision where cultural heritage institutions and beyond actively cultivate collaboration and enthusiastically embrace community-driven standards that enable semantic interoperability. In cases where implementation of the standards may not be feasible, I advocate that institutions consider adopting LOUD design principles as essential socio-technical practices. An HTML version of my thesis will be accessible on this site upon its completion, while the research outcomes associated with my PhD can also be found here. If you just want to know more about LOUD, I’ve written a summary about its design principles and community-driven standards. Context My journey into the Digital Humanities Lab of the University of Basel began as an undergraduate in Information Science, undertaking an internship that spanned from August to October 2016. This period marked the start of my deep involvement with the IIIF community, a pivotal step that would significantly shape my academic and research pursuits. The experience gained during this internship not only provided me with a solid foundation in Digital Humanities but also sparked my interest in leveraging linked open data and standardised application programming interfaces (APIs) for cultural heritage preservation and accessibility. It was within one of these stimulating environments that I found the inspiration and support needed to embark on a doctoral journey, starting my PhD in February 2021. The thesis is grounded as part of the SNSF-funded Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA) research project (2021-2025), a four-year interdisciplinary effort, which aims to develop a Citizen Science platform around three photographic collections from the archives of Cultural Anthropology Switzerland (CAS), formerly the Swiss Society for Folklore Studies, i.e. the Atlas of Swiss Folklore (SGV_05), Kreis Family (SGV_10), and Ernst Brunner (SGV_12). The research project is led by the University of Basel (Institute for Cultural Anthropology and European Ethnology as well as the Digital Humanities Lab) and the Bern Academy of the Arts (HKB). There is more information about the PIA research project and my involvement therein on a dedicated page.

The PIA project bridges the realms of data and tangible objects through an interdisciplinary approach, bringing together cultural anthropology, technology and design to examine both analogue and digital archives. It explores participatory knowledge practices within image archives, encourages collaboration across disciplines, and develops digital tools to help contextualise and connect images. This initiative aims to improve the preservation and sharing of knowledge by inviting both the scholarly community and the public to actively participate in understanding its history and current practices. Through workshops and user interviews, the project aims to identify new needs in digital and process-oriented knowledge creation. Using three collections from the photographic archives of Cultural Anthropology Switzerland (CAS), the project develops interfaces for collaborative indexing and access to archival content. These interfaces, including both graphical and application programming interfaces (APIs), facilitate the co-creation and visualisation of knowledge and offer a reflective and intuitive user experience. At the same time, the project is assessing the analogue and digital phases of archiving from an anthropological, technical and communicative point of view, involving experts from the University of Basel and the Bern University of the Arts.

      "content_html": "ol { list-style-type: upper-alpha; } Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) A summary page about LOUD, page in construction… The Semantic Web, with its use of Resource Description Framework (RDF) graphs, offers significant potential for data modelling and reasoning, but faces challenges in terms of query complexity, data handling, and visualisation. Despite these obstacles, the advent of JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data (JSON-LD) represents a notable advance, providing a flexible data representation that addresses some of these issues by allowing dual treatment as both JSON and a graph. Linked Open Data (LOD) has been pivotal in fostering a web of openly connected datasets. The progression to Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) underscores an evolution towards making data not just accessible and linked but also readily usable for a broader audience, particularly software developers. This shift is propelled by the understanding that data’s real value is unlocked through its usage. LOUD aims to enhance scalability, both from technical perspectives and in terms of data production and adoption, making data more interconnected and thus more useful. JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data (JSON-LD) JSON-LD is a modern web standard designed to simplify the encoding of linked data using the widely known JSON format. As a compact and easy-to-manage data format, JSON-LD enhances the ability to share structured data across disparate systems on the Web, while embedding rich semantic capabilities. It achieves this by allowing data to be serialised in a way that is compatible with traditional JSON, yet interpretable by RDF-based semantic processing tools. At its core, JSON-LD introduces a context (@context) that maps terms in a JSON document to Internationalised Resource Identifiers (IRIs) used in RDF vocabularies. This mapping allows JSON documents to be interpreted as RDF graphs, facilitating the integration of structured data into the Semantic Web without requiring developers to depart from familiar JSON syntax. The design of JSON-LD aims to bridge the gap between the ease of use of JSON and the rich data connectivity and interoperability offered by RDF. The development of JSON-LD was motivated by the need to make linked data more accessible to Web developers and to encourage wider adoption of Semantic Web technologies. By embedding semantic annotations directly into JSON, JSON-LD enables developers to contribute to the linked data cloud with a minimal learning curve, accelerating the growth of a semantically rich, interconnected web of data. Per the JSON-LD 1.1. specification: JSON-LD is a concrete RDF syntax as described in RDF11-CONCEPTS. Hence, a JSON-LD document is both an RDF document and a JSON document and correspondingly represents an instance of an RDF data model. However, JSON-LD also extends the RDF data model to optionally allow JSON-LD to serialize generalized RDF Datasets. The strategic adoption of JSON-LD as a means to reconcile the simplicity of JSON with the descriptive power of RDF has sparked an insightful debate about its practical implications and its classification as a polyglot format. A blog post by Tess O’Connor outlines several challenges that emerge from this approach, including issues related to dual data models, algorithmic complexity, and the potential brittleness and performance impacts of JSON-LD’s @context mechanism. To address these challenges, a strategic focus on simplicity and clarity is advocated. Adopting a straightforward JSON format that doesn’t require knowledge of RDF can simplify interactions and improve the appeal and usability of the data. In addition, creating canonical mappings from JSON to RDF addresses the needs of RDF users while maintaining the accessibility of the base format. In addition, the adoption of stable sets of @context is critical for consistent data exchange. However, this polyglot characterisation of JSON-LD has been met with counter-arguments, such as those from Pierre-Antoine Champin, that offer a different perspective. Critics argue that JSON-LD should not be considered a polyglot format in the strictest sense because it operates on a “JSON then JSON-LD” basis rather than an “either/or” scenario. In this view, any JSON-LD processor first interprets the document as JSON before applying the JSON-LD layer, similar to how other JSON formats, such as GeoJSON, encode specific types of information beyond the basic JSON structures. This process does not make these formats polyglots, but rather extensions of JSON that provide mappings to more complex data models, thus emphasising JSON-LD’s role in simplifying the transition to semantically enriched data on the web. Building upon this understanding, the LOUD design principles emerge as guiding forces in the quest to make data not only accessible and interconnected but fundamentally usable and intuitive for developers and end-users alike. LOUD Design Principles One of the main purposes of LOUD is to make the data more easily accessible to software developers, who play a key role in interacting with the data and building software and services on top of it, and to some extent to academics. As such, striking a delicate balance between the dual imperatives of data completeness and accuracy, which depend on the underlying ontological construct, and the pragmatic considerations of scalability and usability, becomes imperative. Similar to Tim-Berners Lee’s Five Star Open Data Deployment Scheme, Robert Sanderson listed five design principles that underpin LOUD: The right Abstraction for the audience Few Barriers to entry Comprehensible by introspection Documentation with working examples Few Exceptions, instead many consistent patterns A. The right Abstraction for the audience Developers do not need the same level of access to data as ontologists, in the same way that a driver does not need the same level of access to the inner workings of their car as a mechanic. Use cases and requirements should drive the interoperability layer between systems, not ontological purity. B. Few Barriers to entry It should be easy to get started with the data and build something. If it takes a long time to understand the model, ontology, sparql query syntax and so forth, then developers will look for easier targets. Conversely, if it is easy to start and incrementally improve, then more people will use the data. C. Comprehensible by introspection The data should be understandable to a large degree simply by looking at it, rather than requiring the developer to read the ontology and vocabularies. Using JSON-LD lets us to talk to the developer in their language, which they already understand. D. Documentation with working examples You can never intuit all of the rules for the data. Documentation clarifies the patterns that the developer can expect to encounter, such that they can implement robustly. Example use cases allow contextualization for when the pattern will be encountered, and working examples let you drop the data into the system to see if it implements that pattern correctly. E. Few Exceptions, instead many consistent patterns Every exception that you have in an API (and hence ontology) is another rule that the developer needs to learn in order to use the system. Every exception is jarring, and requires additional code to manage. While not everything is homogenous, a set of patterns that manage exceptions well is better than many custom fields. LOUD Standards Systems embodying LOUD principles include the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF), the Web Annotation Data Model, and Linked Art, demonstrating the ethos of making data more accessible, connected, and usable: International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF), especially the IIIF Presentation API 3.0 which describes how the structure and layout of a digital object can be made available in a standard manner, defining their appearance in viewers and players through the Manifest, a JSON-LD file bundling all elements of a IIIF resource with essential metadata and structural information. Web Annotation Data Model: It offers a standardised framework for creating annotations on web resources, promoting semantic data integration and use across the web. Linked Art: A community effort to define a metadata application profile and API for describing and interacting with cultural heritage resources. IIIF and Linked Art are both community-driven initiatives. (…) IIIF IIIF is both a model for presenting and annotating content as well as a global community that develops shared application programming interfaces (APIs), implements them in software, and exposes interoperable content. Currently, IIIF has introduced six specifications, with the Image and Presentation APIs being the most notable, both updated to version 3 in June 2020 and often considered the core IIIF APIs. Additionally, the Content Search and Authorization Flow APIs, both at version 2 and released in 2022 and 2023 respectively, are expected to receive updates to match the core APIs’ standards. The Change Discovery and Content State APIs, both in version 1.0, play essential roles in discovering, aggregating, and sharing IIIF resources. Despite its strengths in facilitating the sharing and interoperability of digital objects, IIIF can sometimes appear disconnected, especially in contexts where discovery and linking to semantic data is not fully realised. However, this perceived disconnect provides an opportunity for improvement through the implementation of robust discovery mechanisms. (…) You need an iFrame capable browser to view this. Web Annotation Data Model The Web Annotation Data Model is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standard that provides an extensible and interoperable framework for creating and sharing annotations across various platforms. It defines relationships between resources using an RDF graph, which includes the annotation, a web resource, the body, and the target. This model allows a single comment to be associated with multiple resources. Here is an example of machine-generated annotations in a IIIF setting. The JSON-LD snippet represents an AnnotationPage that contains one or more annotations related to a particular IIIF resource. { &quot;@context&quot;: &quot;http://iiif.io/api/presentation/3/context.json&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;https://iiif.participatory-archives.ch/annotations/SGV_12N_08589-p1-list.json&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;AnnotationPage&quot;, &quot;items&quot;: [ { &quot;@context&quot;: &quot;http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;https://iiif.participatory-archives.ch/annotations/SGV_12N_08589-p1-list/annotation-436121.json&quot;, &quot;motivation&quot;: &quot;commenting&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Annotation&quot;, &quot;body&quot;: [ { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;TextualBody&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;person&quot;, &quot;purpose&quot;: &quot;commenting&quot; }, { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;TextualBody&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;Object Detection (vitrivr)&quot;, &quot;purpose&quot;: &quot;tagging&quot; }, { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;TextualBody&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;Detection score: 0.9574&lt;/small&gt;&quot;, &quot;purpose&quot;: &quot;commenting&quot; } ], &quot;target&quot;: { &quot;source&quot;: &quot;https://iiif.participatory-archives.ch/SGV_12N_08589/canvas/p1&quot;, &quot;selector&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;FragmentSelector&quot;, &quot;conformsTo&quot;: &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;xywh=319,2942,463,523&quot; }, &quot;dcterms:isPartOf&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Manifest&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;https://iiif.participatory-archives.ch/SGV_12N_08589/manifest.json&quot; } } }, Body The body of an annotation is where the content of the annotation is defined. In this example, there are three textual bodies: A “TextualBody” with the value “person” for commenting. Another “TextualBody” with the value “Object Detection (vitrivr)” for tagging. A third “TextualBody” with HTML content indicating a detection score, also for commenting. These bodies represent the content of the annotation, including comments and tags related to the annotated resource. Target The target specifies where the annotation applies. In this setting, it points to a specific area of a IIIF Canvas. Key details include: The source URL, identifying the specific Canvas within this IIIF Presentation API 3.0 resource. A selector of type “FragmentSelector”, using the Media Fragments specification (with a value indicating the specific rectangular area on the canvas targeted by the annotation). A link (dcterms:isPartOf) to the IIIF Manifest that the Canvas is part of. Linked Art Linked Art is a community and a CIDOC (ICOM International Committee for Documentation) Working Group collaborating to define a metadata application profile for describing cultural heritage, and the technical means for conveniently interacting with it. Level Linked Art Conceptual Model CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) Ontology RDF encoding of CRM 7.1, plus extensions Vocabulary Getty Vocabularies, mainly the Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), as well as the Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN) and the Union List of Artist Names (ULAN) Profile Object-based cultural heritage (mainly art museum oriented) API JSON-LD 1.1, following REST (representational state transfer) and web patterns Linked Art from 50,000 feet (…) LOUD Ecosystem These three systems are complementary and can be used either separately or in conjunction. LOUD-Driven Infrastructure [Felsing et al. 2023] A LOUD ecosystem is characterised by an emphasis on interoperability between independently developed systems. This approach to design and implementation promotes semantic interoperability, ensuring that data can be understood and used across platforms and applications without the need for centralised coordination. By adhering to the LOUD principles, systems can communicate more effectively and share data in a way that is meaningful and useful to a wide range of users. This level of interoperability supports the creation of a more integrated and accessible digital environment, where data from different sources can be seamlessly connected and used for a variety of purposes.",

Two research axes or perspectives have been identified to investigate LOUD, the first axis focusing on community practices, i.e. assessing the mechanisms by which organisations, individuals and apparatuses are entangled in consensus-making, and the second on semantic interoperability, i.e. how to make data meaningful to machines in a standardised and interoperable manner. This work is grounded as part of the SNSF-funded research project Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA), which aims to develop a citizen science platform around three photographic collections from the archives of Cultural Anthropology Switzerland (CAS), formerly the Swiss Society for Folklore Studies. The theoretical framework is firmly rooted in Actor-Network Theory (ANT), a constructivist approach mainly defined by Bruno Latour, as one of the objectives is to describe the associations between actors and the social fabrics of the LOUD ecosystem as well as to highlight the importance of non-human actors, such as the data models developed in the context of the PIA research project. Additionally, the theoretical framework is enriched by integrating complementary perspectives from Anna Haraway’s Situated Knowledges, Susan Leigh Star’s Boundary Objects, and Luciano Floridi’s Philosophy of Information. Each of these frameworks contributes uniquely to our understanding of LOUD and its socio-technical landscape. Overall, this doctoral thesis aims to contribute to the understanding of LOUD and their adoption within cultural heritage institutions. By investigating community practices and semantic interoperability, this research seeks to identify and address challenges and provide insights into how LOUD can be effectively used for the description and dissemination of cultural heritage resources, taking into account all the human and non-human entities needed to develop those standards and to learn from it in the broader cultural heritage field. Moreover, this research aims to recognise the evolution of community practices and the potential bias of a western-centred view.
