      "content_html": "LOUD for Cultural Heritage ‚Äì PhD Thesis by Julien A. Raemy ‚ÄúLinked Open Usable Data (LOUD) for Cultural Heritage&quot; not only encapsulates the essence of my PhD thesis, but also reflects a passion, as I have been actively involved in both the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) and the Linked Art communities for many years. It describes a vision where cultural heritage institutions and beyond actively cultivate collaboration and enthusiastically embrace community-driven standards that enable semantic interoperability. In cases where implementation of the standards may not be feasible, I advocate that institutions consider adopting LOUD design principles as essential socio-technical practices. An HTML version of my thesis will be accessible on this site upon its completion (January/February 2025), while the research outcomes associated with my PhD can also be found here. If you just want to know more about LOUD, I‚Äôve written a summary about its design principles and community-driven standards. Status üå± Start of the PhD: 1 February 2021 üíª Research &amp; Writing: February 2021 - July 2024 üìÑ Dissertation Submitted: 5 August 2024 üé§ Oral Examination: 18 November 2024 üçæ Celebration üéì Official Publication: TBD Context My journey into the Digital Humanities Lab of the University of Basel began as an undergraduate in Information Science, undertaking an internship that spanned from August to October 2016. This period marked the start of my deep involvement with the IIIF community, a pivotal step that would significantly shape my academic and research pursuits. The experience gained during this internship not only provided me with a solid foundation in Digital Humanities but also sparked my interest in leveraging linked open data and standardised application programming interfaces (APIs) for cultural heritage preservation and accessibility. It was within one of these stimulating environments that I found the inspiration and support needed to embark on a doctoral journey, starting my PhD in February 2021. The thesis is grounded as part of the SNSF-funded Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA) research project (2021-2025), a four-year interdisciplinary effort, which aims to develop a Citizen Science platform around three photographic collections from the archives of Cultural Anthropology Switzerland (CAS), formerly the Swiss Society for Folklore Studies, i.e. the Atlas of Swiss Folklore (SGV_05), Kreis Family (SGV_10), and Ernst Brunner (SGV_12). The research project is led by the University of Basel (Institute for Cultural Anthropology and European Ethnology as well as the Digital Humanities Lab) and the Bern Academy of the Arts (Hochschule der K√ºnste Bern - HKB). I was formally involved within the PIA project between February 2021 and March 2024 as an Assistant at the Digital Humanities Lab. Additionally, starting June 2021, I worked with a 20% position as an Interoperability Specialist at DaSCH, Swiss National Data and Service Center for the Humanities, a position that I held until October 2024. I continue to be involved in the project beyond March 2024, albeit solely through my PhD thesis, which was submitted on 5 August 2024 and was successfully defended on 18 November 2024, receiving an overall grade of insigni cum laude (5.4 / 6). In parallel, I have started a new position as a Data Scientist at the Swiss Federal Archives. There is more information about the PIA research project and my involvement therein on a dedicated page.

      "content_html": "ol { list-style-type: upper-alpha; } Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) The Semantic Web, with its use of Resource Description Framework (RDF) graphs, offers significant potential for data modelling and reasoning, but faces challenges in terms of query complexity, data handling, and visualisation. Despite these obstacles, the advent of JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data (JSON-LD) represents a notable advance, providing a flexible data representation that addresses some of these issues by allowing dual treatment as both JSON and a graph. Linked Open Data (LOD) has been pivotal in fostering a web of openly connected datasets. The progression to Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) underscores an evolution towards making data not just accessible and linked but also readily usable for a broader audience, particularly software developers. This shift is propelled by the understanding that data‚Äôs real value is unlocked through its usage. LOUD aims to enhance scalability, both from technical perspectives and in terms of data production and adoption, making data more interconnected and thus more useful. JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data (JSON-LD) JSON-LD is a modern web standard designed to simplify the encoding of linked data using the widely known JSON format. As a compact and easy-to-manage data format, JSON-LD enhances the ability to share structured data across disparate systems on the Web, while embedding rich semantic capabilities. It achieves this by allowing data to be serialised in a way that is compatible with traditional JSON, yet interpretable by RDF-based semantic processing tools. At its core, JSON-LD introduces a context (@ context) that maps terms in a JSON document to Internationalised Resource Identifiers (IRIs) used in RDF vocabularies. This mapping allows JSON documents to be interpreted as RDF graphs, facilitating the integration of structured data into the Semantic Web without requiring developers to depart from familiar JSON syntax. The design of JSON-LD aims to bridge the gap between the ease of use of JSON and the rich data connectivity and interoperability offered by RDF. The development of JSON-LD was motivated by the need to make linked data more accessible to Web developers and to encourage wider adoption of Semantic Web technologies. By embedding semantic annotations directly into JSON, JSON-LD enables developers to contribute to the linked data cloud with a minimal learning curve, accelerating the growth of a semantically rich, interconnected web of data. Per the JSON-LD 1.1. specification: JSON-LD is a concrete RDF syntax as described in RDF11-CONCEPTS. Hence, a JSON-LD document is both an RDF document and a JSON document and correspondingly represents an instance of an RDF data model. However, JSON-LD also extends the RDF data model to optionally allow JSON-LD to serialize generalized RDF Datasets. The strategic adoption of JSON-LD as a means to reconcile the simplicity of JSON with the descriptive power of RDF has sparked an insightful debate about its practical implications and its classification as a polyglot format. A blog post by Tess O‚ÄôConnor outlines several challenges that emerge from this approach, including issues related to dual data models, algorithmic complexity, and the potential brittleness and performance impacts of JSON-LD‚Äôs @ context mechanism. To address these challenges, a strategic focus on simplicity and clarity is advocated. Adopting a straightforward JSON format that doesn‚Äôt require knowledge of RDF can simplify interactions and improve the appeal and usability of the data. In addition, creating canonical mappings from JSON to RDF addresses the needs of RDF users while maintaining the accessibility of the base format. In addition, the adoption of stable sets of @ context is critical for consistent data exchange. However, this polyglot characterisation of JSON-LD has been met with counter-arguments, such as those from Pierre-Antoine Champin, that offer a different perspective. Critics argue that JSON-LD should not be considered a polyglot format in the strictest sense because it operates on a ‚ÄúJSON then JSON-LD‚Äù basis rather than an ‚Äúeither/or‚Äù scenario. In this view, any JSON-LD processor first interprets the document as JSON before applying the JSON-LD layer, similar to how other JSON formats, such as GeoJSON, encode specific types of information beyond the basic JSON structures. This process does not make these formats polyglots, but rather extensions of JSON that provide mappings to more complex data models, thus emphasising JSON-LD‚Äôs role in simplifying the transition to semantically enriched data on the web. Building upon this understanding, the LOUD design principles emerge as guiding forces in the quest to make data not only accessible and interconnected but fundamentally usable and intuitive for developers and end-users alike. LOUD Design Principles One of the main purposes of LOUD is to make the data more easily accessible to software developers, who play a key role in interacting with the data and building software and services on top of it, and to some extent to academics. As such, striking a delicate balance between the dual imperatives of data completeness and accuracy, which depend on the underlying ontological construct, and the pragmatic considerations of scalability and usability, becomes imperative. Similar to Tim-Berners Lee‚Äôs Five Star Open Data Deployment Scheme, Robert Sanderson listed five design principles that underpin LOUD: The right Abstraction for the audience Few Barriers to entry Comprehensible by introspection Documentation with working examples Few Exceptions, instead many consistent patterns A. The right Abstraction for the audience Developers do not need the same level of access to data as ontologists, in the same way that a driver does not need the same level of access to the inner workings of their car as a mechanic. Use cases and requirements should drive the interoperability layer between systems, not ontological purity. B. Few Barriers to entry It should be easy to get started with the data and build something. If it takes a long time to understand the model, ontology, sparql query syntax and so forth, then developers will look for easier targets. Conversely, if it is easy to start and incrementally improve, then more people will use the data. C. Comprehensible by introspection The data should be understandable to a large degree simply by looking at it, rather than requiring the developer to read the ontology and vocabularies. Using JSON-LD lets us to talk to the developer in their language, which they already understand. D. Documentation with working examples You can never intuit all of the rules for the data. Documentation clarifies the patterns that the developer can expect to encounter, such that they can implement robustly. Example use cases allow contextualization for when the pattern will be encountered, and working examples let you drop the data into the system to see if it implements that pattern correctly. E. Few Exceptions, instead many consistent patterns Every exception that you have in an API (and hence ontology) is another rule that the developer needs to learn in order to use the system. Every exception is jarring, and requires additional code to manage. While not everything is homogenous, a set of patterns that manage exceptions well is better than many custom fields. LOUD Standards Systems embodying LOUD principles include the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF), the Web Annotation Data Model, and Linked Art, demonstrating the ethos of making data more accessible, connected, and usable: International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF), especially the IIIF Presentation API 3.0 which describes how the structure and layout of a digital object can be made available in a standard manner, defining their appearance in viewers and players through the Manifest, a JSON-LD file bundling all elements of a IIIF resource with essential metadata and structural information. Web Annotation Data Model: It offers a standardised framework for creating annotations on web resources, promoting semantic data integration and use across the web. Linked Art: A community effort to define a metadata application profile and API for describing and interacting with cultural heritage resources. IIIF and Linked Art are exemplary community-driven efforts, where ongoing engagement and collaboration within their respective communities ensure continuous development and updates. As for the Web Annotation Data Model, while it doesn‚Äôt operate as an active community, it remains a recognised LOUD standard. In the event that updates are needed, a dedicated World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) working group would probably be re-established or revamped. IIIF IIIF is both a model for presenting and annotating content as well as a global community that develops shared application programming interfaces (APIs), implements them in software, and exposes interoperable content. IIIF was initially established in 2011 as a community-based initiative that emerged from the convergence of two pivotal endeavours. One strand of this narrative revolved around the imperative to facilitate the seamless exchange of high-definition images over the internet. This aspiration arose as a practical solution to mitigate the proliferation of duplicated images required for distinct projects. The desire to avoid the necessity of sending substantial volumes of image data via conventional methods, such as mailing terabytes of data on hard drives, led to the contemplation of a web-based approach for sharing images that could break down silos. The second strand, interwoven with the first, emanated from the explorations and experiments surrounding the interoperability of digitised medieval manuscripts. The DMSTech group at Stanford, operational from 2010 to 2013, provided the fertile ground for these reflections. These deliberations ultimately led to the development of the Shared Canvas Data Model, which remains a foundational influence on the IIIF Presentation API to this day. As of August 2024, IIIF has introduced six specifications, with the Image and Presentation APIs being the most notable, both updated to version 3 in June 2020 and often considered the core IIIF APIs. Additionally, the Content Search and Authorization Flow APIs, both at version 2 and released in 2022 and 2023 respectively, are expected to receive updates to match the core APIs‚Äô standards. The Change Discovery and Content State APIs, both in version 1.0, play essential roles in discovering, aggregating, and sharing IIIF resources. The development of the IIIF specifications is firmly rooted in the IIIF design principles, which have influenced similar methodologies such as the LOUD design principles. These principles emphasise clear, practical goals aligned with shared use cases to meet the needs of developers effectively. By focusing on simplicity, minimal barriers to entry, and adherence to good web and Linked Data practices, these principles have been crucial in making the IIIF APIs both user-friendly and technically sound. They advocate for ease of implementation and internationalisation, promoting a flexible yet cohesive structure that naturally leads to usable and accessible data. IIIF Image API The IIIF Image API is a RESTful web service that allows users to interact with images in a highly flexible manner. It facilitates the retrieval of images via standard HTTPS requests, effectively serving as an agreement between an image client and an image server to deliver image pixels. This API defines its own URI syntax, enabling users to interact with images in two primary modes: image requests and image information requests. In the image request mode, users can retrieve a specific image derived from the underlying content, with parameters that control the region, size, rotation, quality, and format of the returned image. This allows for advanced functionalities such as panning, deep zooming, and the sharing of specific regions of interest within an image. The image information request mode (info.json) provides details about the image service itself in JSON-LD, including the characteristics and available functionalities of the image service. IIIF Presentation API The IIIF Presentation API‚Äôs goal is to deliver structured and human-readable information about digital objects or collections, designed to drive remote viewing experiences. It is a JSON-LD-based framework for displaying minimal descriptive and legal metadata, focusing primarily on enhancing the user experience rather than providing semantic metadata for search engines. However, it does offer flexibility for IIIF adopters to incorporate structured metadata for discovery purposes through properties like rdfs:seeAlso. Loosely based on the Shared Canvas Data Model, the Presentation API organises content into four main resource types: Collection, Manifest, Canvas, and Range. Each of these serves a distinct function within the API‚Äôs framework, enabling a rich and interactive presentation of digital objects. Additionally, the API integrates types defined by the Web Annotation Data Model, such as AnnotationCollection, AnnotationPage, Annotation, and Content, further enhancing its capacity to deliver detailed and structured digital content. Compatible software These APIs, central to the IIIF ecosystem, underscore the initiative‚Äôs commitment to interoperability, flexibility, and a user-centric approach in the handling and presentation of digital images and their associated metadata. The widespread adoption of these APIs by numerous institutions around the world highlights their robustness and utility. The suite of IIIF-compliant software encompasses a diverse range of tools, each catering to specific aspects of the framework. Central to this suite are image servers, predominantly tailored to align with the IIIF Image API, such as IIPImage, Cantaloupe, or SIPI. Complementing these servers are image viewers, designed to be compatible with either the Image API alone, like OpenSeadragon (OSD) and Leaflet-IIIF, or with both of the core IIIF APIs. With the release of version 3.0 of the Presentation API, A/V players have also been developed, which frequently comply with the Image API as well. Examples of known clients that support the Image and Presentation APIs 3.0 are Mirador, the Universal Viewer (UV), Annona, Clover, and Ramp. As support and behaviour vary, a dedicated IIIF 3.0 Viewer Matrix was created. The embedded viewer below is Mirador, a powerful IIIF-compliant client. Stanford University played a pivotal role in rebuilding it, marking a key milestone that exemplifies the spirit of community-driven effort within the IIIF initiative. This endeavour, which has since been placed in the hands of the community, was later augmented through a collaborative partnership with Harvard University Library. The cooperative dynamics and collective contributions fundamental to the success and advancement of IIIF are clearly reflected in the widespread adoption and continued development of Mirador.

Web Annotation Data Model The Web Annotation Data Model is a W3C standard that provides an extensible and interoperable framework for creating and sharing annotations across various platforms. It defines relationships between resources using an RDF graph, which includes key components such as the annotation, a web resource, the body, and the target. This model allows a single comment to be associated with multiple resources, enhancing the semantic integration of data across the web. The Web Annotation Working Group, which was chartered from August 2014 to October 2016 and extended to February 2017, played a pivotal role in developing and officially vetting this specification as a standard. Here is an example of machine-generated annotations in a IIIF setting. The JSON-LD snippet represents an AnnotationPage that contains one or more annotations related to a particular IIIF resource. { &quot;@ context&quot;: &quot;http://iiif.io/api/presentation/3/context.json&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;https://iiif.participatory-archives.ch/annotations/SGV_12N_08589-p1-list.json&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;AnnotationPage&quot;, &quot;items&quot;: [ { &quot;@ context&quot;: &quot;http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;https://iiif.participatory-archives.ch/annotations/SGV_12N_08589-p1-list/annotation-436121.json&quot;, &quot;motivation&quot;: &quot;commenting&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Annotation&quot;, &quot;body&quot;: [ { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;TextualBody&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;person&quot;, &quot;purpose&quot;: &quot;commenting&quot; }, { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;TextualBody&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;Object Detection (vitrivr)&quot;, &quot;purpose&quot;: &quot;tagging&quot; }, { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;TextualBody&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;Detection score: 0.9574&lt;/small&gt;&quot;, &quot;purpose&quot;: &quot;commenting&quot; } ], &quot;target&quot;: { &quot;source&quot;: &quot;https://iiif.participatory-archives.ch/SGV_12N_08589/canvas/p1&quot;, &quot;selector&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;FragmentSelector&quot;, &quot;conformsTo&quot;: &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;xywh=319,2942,463,523&quot; }, &quot;dcterms:isPartOf&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Manifest&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;https://iiif.participatory-archives.ch/SGV_12N_08589/manifest.json&quot; } } }, Body The body of an annotation is where the content of the annotation is defined. In this example, there are three textual bodies: A ‚ÄúTextualBody‚Äù with the value ‚Äúperson‚Äù for commenting. Another ‚ÄúTextualBody‚Äù with the value ‚ÄúObject Detection (vitrivr)‚Äù for tagging. A third ‚ÄúTextualBody‚Äù with HTML content indicating a detection score, also for commenting. These bodies represent the content of the annotation, including comments and tags related to the annotated resource. Target The target specifies where the annotation applies. In this setting, it points to a specific area of a IIIF Canvas. Key details include: The source URL, identifying the specific Canvas within this IIIF Presentation API 3.0 resource. A selector of type ‚ÄúFragmentSelector‚Äù, using the Media Fragments specification (with a value indicating the specific rectangular area on the canvas targeted by the annotation). A link (dcterms:isPartOf) to the IIIF Manifest that the Canvas is part of. Linked Art Linked Art is a community and a CIDOC (ICOM International Committee for Documentation) Working Group collaborating to define a metadata application profile for describing cultural heritage, and the technical means for conveniently interacting with it. It aims to solve problems from real data, is designed for usability and ease of implementation, which are prerequisites for sustainability. Linked Art presents a layered framework that distinguishes between the conceptual and implementation aspects. At its core, Linked Art is a data model or metadata application profile that draws extensively from the RDF implementation of version 7.1.3 of CIDOC-CRM. The Getty Vocabularies are leveraged as core sources of identity for domain-specific terminology. JSON-LD 1.1 is chosen as the preferred serialisation format, promoting clarity and interoperability. This framework constructs common patterns, integrating conceptual models, ontologies, and vocabulary terms. These elements are derived from real-world scenarios and contributions from the diverse participants and institutions within the Linked Art community. Level Linked Art Conceptual Model CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) Ontology RDF encoding of CRM 7.1, plus extensions Vocabulary Getty Vocabularies, mainly the Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), as well as the Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN) and the Union List of Artist Names (ULAN) Profile Object-based cultural heritage (mainly art museum oriented) API JSON-LD 1.1, following representational state transfer (REST) and web patterns The Linked Art data model, in its domain-specific application, particularly resonates with five of these facets: ‚Äúwhat,‚Äù ‚Äúwhere,‚Äù ‚Äúwho,‚Äù ‚Äúhow,‚Äù and ‚Äúwhen.‚Äù Linked Art from 50,000 feet Exploring the specifics of the Linked Art API, four key areas are highlighted: ease of implementation, consistency across representations, division of information, and URI requirements. Linked Art prioritises ease of implementation, making it simple enough to deploy even with hand-crafted files, though automation is preferred for larger data volumes. A crucial aspect is ensuring consistency across representations, with each relationship contained within a single document to maintain clarity and coherence. The framework also emphasises the division of information, scaling from many to few - such as from a page to a book, and then to a collection - ensuring a clear hierarchy. The API‚Äôs identity and URI requirements are designed for simplicity. One-to-one relationships are embedded directly without needing separate URIs, making the data model more accessible. URIs for records are kept simple, with no internal structure, ensuring ease of use and navigation. This approach makes Linked Art an efficient tool for representing and managing cultural heritage data. In Linked Art, the division of the graph avoids duplication of definitions across records. Full URIs are used for references, simplifying client processing. Embedded structures do not carry URIs, preventing unnecessary complexity. The Linked Art API currently features eleven endpoints, which align with the conceptual model: Concepts: Types, materials, languages, and others as full records rather than external references Digital Objects: Images, services, and other digital objects Events: Related activities that are not part of other entities Groups: Groups and organisations People: Individuals Physical Objects: Artworks, buildings, books, and other physical items Places: Geographic locations Provenance Activities: Events in the history of a physical item Sets: Collections and exhibition sets Textual Works: Distinct textual entities like book content or journal articles Visual Works: Image content like paintings or drawings Each endpoint is supported by detailed documentation, including the required and permitted patterns, along with a corresponding JSON schema. LOUD Ecosystem These three systems are complementary and can be used either separately or in conjunction. LOUD-Driven Infrastructure [Felsing et al. 2023] A LOUD ecosystem is characterised by an emphasis on interoperability between independently developed systems. This approach to design and implementation promotes semantic interoperability, ensuring that data can be understood and used across platforms and applications without the need for centralised coordination. By adhering to the LOUD principles, systems can communicate more effectively and share data in a way that is meaningful and useful to a wide range of users. This level of interoperability supports the creation of a more integrated and accessible digital environment, where data from different sources can be seamlessly connected and used for a variety of purposes.",

      "content_html": "Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA) Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA) is a project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) under the Sinergia funding scheme from February 2021 to January 2025. The PIA project wanted to bridge the realms of data and tangible objects through an interdisciplinary approach, bringing together cultural anthropology, technology and design to examine both analogue and digital archives. It explored participatory knowledge practices within image archives, encourages collaboration across disciplines, and develops digital tools to help contextualise and connect images. This initiative aimed to improve the preservation and sharing of knowledge by inviting both the scholarly community and the public to actively participate in understanding its history and current practices. Through workshops and user interviews, the project identified new needs in digital and process-oriented knowledge creation. Using three collections from the photographic archives of Cultural Anthropology Switzerland (CAS), the project developed interfaces for collaborative indexing and access to archival content. These interfaces, including both graphical and application programming interfaces (APIs), facilitate the co-creation and visualisation of knowledge and offer a reflective and intuitive user experience. At the same time, the project assessed the analogue and digital phases of archiving from an anthropological, technical and communicative point of view, involving experts from the University of Basel and the Bern University of the Arts. Atlas of the Swiss Folklore SGV_05 Atlas of Swiss Folklore consists of 292 maps and 1,000 pages of commentary published between 1950 and 1995. Commissioned by CAS, the collection involved an extensive survey of the Swiss population in the 1930s and 1940s, covering topics like everyday life, local laws, superstitions, celebrations, and labour. The survey was conducted by both researchers and local contributors, resulting in a collection that reflects everyday life in Switzerland before the postwar modernisation period. The project also involved significant efforts in restoration, digitisation, cataloguing, and indexing as part of the PIA research project. Kreis Family SGV_10 Kreis Family comprises approximately 20,000 photographic objects, with a quarter organised into 93 photo albums. This collection, spanning from the 1850s to the 1980s, belonged to a wealthy Basel family and was acquired by CAS in 1991. Despite its initial disorganisation, CAS meticulously catalogued and preserved the collection, which offers a detailed insight into urban bourgeois culture and the development of private photography over a century. The materials range from prints to negatives, in various formats and techniques, from daguerreotypes to modern paper prints. While some were digitised in 2014, most of the work was completed during the PIA project. You need an iFrame capable browser to view this. Ernst Brunner SGV_12 Ernst Brunner is a collection of about 48,000 negatives and 20,000 prints donated to the CAS archives by Ernst Brunner, a self-taught photojournalist active mainly in the 1930s and 1940s. His work, which documents Swiss society‚Äôs rural and urban life, is highly regarded. Brunner, who initially worked as a carpenter influenced by the Bauhaus and Neues Bauen movements, became a key visual chronicler of his era. While the black and white negatives were digitised between 2014 and 2018, the prints selected by Brunner were digitised at the end of the PIA research project. Brunner, Ernst.

Raemy (University of Basel) https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4711-5759 Supervisors Prof. Dr. Peter Fornaro (University of Basel) https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1485-4923 Prof. Dr. Walter Leimgruber (University of Basel) Dr. Robert Sanderson (Yale University) https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4441-6852 Abstract Digital technologies have fundamentally transformed how Cultural Heritage (CH) collections are accessed and engaged with. Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) specifications, including the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) Presentation API 3.0, Linked Art, and the W3C Web Annotation Data Model, have emerged as web standards to facilitate the description and dissemination of these valuable resources. Despite the widespread adoption of IIIF, implementing LOUD specifications, particularly in combination, remains challenging. This is especially evident in the development and assessment of infrastructures, or sites of assemblage, that support these standards. This research is guided by two perspectives: community practices and semantic interoperability. The first perspective assesses how organizations, individuals, and apparatuses engage with and contribute to the consensus-making processes surrounding LOUD. By examining these practices, the social fabrics of the LOUD ecosystem can be better understood. The second perspective focuses on making data meaningful to machines in a standardized, interoperable manner that promotes the exchange of well-formed information. This research is grounded in the SNSF-funded project, Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA) (2021‚Äì2025), which aims to develop a citizen science platform for three photographic collections from the Cultural Anthropology Switzerland (CAS) archives. Actor-Network Theory (ANT) forms the theoretical foundation, aiming to describe the collaborative structures of the LOUD ecosystem and emphasize the role of non-human actors. Beyond its implementation within the PIA project, this research includes an analysis of the social dynamics within the IIIF and Linked Art communities and an investigation of Yale‚Äôs Collections Discovery platform, LUX. The research identifies socio-technical requirements for developing specifications aligned with LOUD principles. It also examines how the implementation of LOUD standards in PIA highlights their potential benefits and limitations in facilitating data reuse and broader participation. Additionally, it explores Yale University‚Äôs large-scale deployment of LOUD standards, emphasizing the importance of ensuring consistency between Linked Art and IIIF resources within the LUX platform for the CH domain. The core methodology of this thesis is an actor- and practice-centered inquiry, focusing on a detailed examination of specific cosmologies within LOUD-driven communities, PIA, and LUX. This micro-perspective approach provides rich empirical evidence to unravel the intricate web of cultural processes and constellations in these contexts. Key empirical findings indicate that LOUD enhances the discoverability and integration of data in CH, requiring community-driven consensus on model interoperability. However, significant challenges include engaging marginalized groups, sustaining long-term participation, and balancing technological and social factors. Strategic use of technology and the capture of digital materiality are critical, but LOUD also poses challenges related to resource investment, data consistency, and the broader implementation of complex patterns. LOUD should lead efforts to improve the accessibility and usability of CH data. The community-driven methodologies of IIIF and Linked Art inherently foster collaboration and transparency, making these standards essential tools in evolving data management practices. Even for institutions and projects that do not adopt these specifications, the socio-technical practices of LOUD offer vital insights into effective digital stewardship and strategies for community engagement.

Introduction Since its inception in 2011, the IIIF has revolutionised[1] the accessibility of image-based resources. Initially driven by the needs of manuscript scholars, IIIF focused on two-dimensional images, but has since expanded to encompass a wide range of image-based resources, including audiovisual materials and, in the near future, 3D images. Similarly, Linked Art, formally established in 2017, initially concentrated on art museum objects but has since broadened its scope to model a variety of CH entities, leveraging CIDOC-CRM, a renowned ontology in the museum and DH space. Both initiatives aim to break down silos: IIIF focuses on improving the presentation of digital objects, while both initiatives enhance their dissemination. Together, they make CH data more accessible through IIIF and more meaningful through Linked Art for machines. These efforts have primarily benefited the CH domain. A key commonality is that the main APIs these communities create align with the LOUD design principles, either intentionally or empirically demonstrated through use cases. These principles enable software developers to develop compliant tools and services without needing to fully understand RDF, a syntax for representing information on the web. Additionally, they may not need to grasp all LOD principles, which promote the interlinking of data from diverse datasets using tools like KOS such as thesauri. WADM, a W3C standard, is also recognised as a LOUD specification. It provides a framework for creating interoperable annotations on web resources, facilitating the linking and sharing of data across different platforms and applications. These LOUD design principles include the right abstraction for the audience, few barriers to entry, comprehensibility by introspection, documentation with working examples, and the use of many consistent patterns rather than few exceptions. Additionally, both IIIF and Linked Art are driven by vibrant communities, mainly comprising GLAM and higher education institutions. While the standards and principles discussed have broad applications, it is important to clarify the scope of this dissertation. This work does not focus on KGs by assessing triplestores ‚Äì databases specifically designed to store and retrieve triples, which are the fundamental data structures in RDF. Similarly, it does not deal with evaluating SPARQL engines, which are specifically designed to query KGs. Additionally, this dissertation does not address the intersection of ML and IIIF, or the ontological reasoning of Linked Art. Instead, this dissertation concentrates on LOUD, the consistency of its standards, design principles and the vibrant communities behind it. It examines JSON-LD serialisation efforts and the crucial intersection required to establish robust semantic interoperability baselines between presentation and semantic layers. It also presents real-world use case implementations, both on a small scale in a laboratory and flexible space within the PIA research project, and on a large scale at Yale, exemplified by the LUX platform that provides access to (meta)data from YUL, YCBA, YUAG, and YPM. The focus is therefore on digital infrastructures capable of delivering JSON-LD files from the above specifications, which are primarily, though not exclusively, CH resources. It is more about the different actors ‚Äì both human and non-human ‚Äì that create and maintain these interconnected systems and the dynamic interactions that sustain them. The deployment of various LOUD specifications addresses the need for semantic interoperability between CH resources and disparate datasets by establishing a standardised approach to representing and linking data, ensuring that information can be seamlessly shared and understood across different platforms and contexts. This dissertation seeks to carve out a distinct niche by addressing an often-overlooked aspect of IIIF and Linked Art. IIIF is sometimes perceived and studied merely as a service or an appendix, with the content it delivers taking precedence. However, this PhD thesis positions IIIF as a first-class citizen worthy of in-depth study. Similarly, Linked Art, despite its potential and its relatively recent establishment, has been the subject of very few scholarly papers. This gap underscores the significance of LOUD in this context. Furthermore, this thesis elevates Linked Art to a position of primary importance, recognising its significance and advocating for its thorough examination. To thoroughly study LOUD and its adherence to design principles, it is essential to immerse ourselves actively in both communities ‚Äì an approach I have embraced for years. The thesis also emphasises the importance of participatory efforts and collaboration between research projects, which typically have shorter lifespans, and memory institutions, which need to implement technical standards as a lingua franca. In doing so, it reveals the mediating role of LOUD in advancing the heritage sphere. To truly understand IIIF, Linked Art, and to a lesser extent WADM, it is crucial to examine the social fabrics and consensus decision-making of each community. Among these considerations are how the specifications can be implemented pragmatically, and how the standards can support the implementation and maintenance of more extensive semantic interoperability efforts. The significance of this research lies in highlighting the commitment and diligence of the individuals and organisations that make up both the IIIF and Linked Art communities. It aims to demonstrate that community-driven practices, such as those exemplified by IIIF and Linked Art, have a potential that goes beyond the mere sharing of digital objects and their associated metadata. The more people who embrace these approaches and implement the associated specifications, the more society as a whole will benefit. Furthermore, this research illustrates that IIIF is no longer limited to two-dimensional images, that Linked Art is not restricted to artworks, and that WADM is a simple, content-agnostic standard that can be easily integrated into a range of systems. This adaptability is a strength of LOUD standards, which are designed to be simple yet effective. LOUD can serve a variety of purposes, primarily rooted in CH, but with the potential to extend its benefits to other sectors. The true beauty of LOUD lies in its ability to foster networking opportunities and transparent socio-technical practices, demonstrating its value beyond mere technical implementation. By emphasising these aspects, this dissertation highlights the wider impact of LOUD in promoting semantic interoperability and enhancing collaborative efforts within the heritage field and beyond. In addition, the implementation of standards through PIA underlines the potential for similar participatory or citizen science projects, while the LUX initiative serves as an illustrative example of robust infrastructure and cross-unit engagement. These examples demonstrate the practical applications and far-reaching implications of adopting LOUD standards in different contexts. This dissertation is structured across ten chapters, each building upon the previous ones up to Chapter 5 to provide a comprehensive understanding of the research. These initial chapters lay the foundation of the study, establishing the context, theoretical framework, and methodological approaches. After this foundational section, Chapters 6, 7, and 8 present empirical studies that, while interconnected, can be read independently if desired. These chapters offer detailed insights into specific aspects of the research and can be appreciated on their own or as part of the broader narrative. The thesis continues with Chapter 2, which extends this introduction by providing more information about the research setting, specifically PIA. Chapter 3 follows with an extensive literature review, offering a comprehensive overview of methods to interlink CH data. Next, Chapter 4 presents the theoretical framework, conceptualised as a toolbox and firmly rooted in ANT, guiding the analysis and discussion throughout the dissertation. Following this, Chapter 5 details the research scope and methodology, explaining the approaches and methods employed in the study. Moving on to the empirical work, Chapter 6 sheds light on the social fabrics of IIIF and Linked Art, exploring the communities and practices that underpin these initiatives.Chapter 7 then examines the implementation of LOUD standards within PIA, highlighting the practical aspects and challenges encountered. This is followed by Chapter 8, which focuses on the LUX initiative at Yale, examining the underlying governance and interdepartmental ownership of the Yale Collections Discovery platform. The discussion of findings is presented in Chapter 9, where the results from the empirical chapters are synthesised and analysed in relation to the theoretical framework. Finally, Chapter 10 concludes the thesis, summarising the key insights and contributions of the research while outlining potential directions for future study. 2. Context In this chapter, I will set the stage for my PhD thesis by providing important background information. First, in , I will explain why I chose the title for my thesis. This will give you an understanding of the main focus and the direction of my research. Next, in , I will describe the PIA research project, which is central to my work. This section will cover the project‚Äôs goals, significance, and overall framework. In , I will detail my specific contributions to the PIA project. I will emphasise how my work fits into the larger project and its importance to my thesis. Finally, in , I will talk about my active participation in the IIIF and Linked Art communities. This section will highlight how my involvement in these communities has influenced my research and its broader implications. 2.1 PhD Title I chose the title as it encapsulates the essence of my research focus but I could have indeed chosen other ones. During the initial stages of my research, multiple working titles were explored to capture the diverse facets of my interests and objectives. If I was quite sure about having in the title after the third iteration, I was quite unsure of what should follow and if a subtitle was actually needed at all. Amidst this dynamic progression, the underlying theme of my research remained steadfast ‚Äì to delve into the transformative potential of LOUD for CH. I also opted to maintain in the title of my thesis subsection. While holds its appeal, my choice reflects a broader narrative that acknowledges the crucial role of CHIs and spotlighting the multifaceted nature of heritage preservation, encapsulating both its digital facets and the essential contribution of individuals and institutions in curating, interpreting, and making heritage accessible. As for the subtitle, while I do explore CoP as defined by @lave_situated_1991 and @wenger_communities_2011 through investigating the social fabrics of the IIIF and Linked Art communities, my main interest lies in the broader application of LOUD for describing and interlinking CH resources. Thus, I decided to opt for the more generic as the first axis or perspective. For the second perspective, I wanted to see how semantic interoperability can be achieved through standards adhering to the LOUD design principles, as they seem to be key enablers for seamless collaboration and knowledge exchange among practitioners. There was a time in my research when I envisaged decoupling and , perceiving them as two distinct dimensions. However, what really captivates me is the unification of these factors to facilitate collective reasoning for both humans and machines. In summary, this title reflects my enthusiasm for using web-based and community-driven technologies to transform the way we understand, share and value CH. 3.

Conclusion For a better understanding of the past, Our images have to be enhanced, A new dialogue in three dimensions, Must have openness at its heart, For somewhere within the archive Of our aggregated minds Are a multitude of questions And a multitude of answers, Simply awaiting to be found. [@mr_gee_day_2023] This chapter brings to a close the journey undertaken since February 2021, aiming to clearly articulate the answers to the research questions, discuss how the research aligns with the objectives, elucidate the significance of the work, outline its shortcomings, and suggest avenues for future research. I had the privilege of hearing the above poem at EuropeanaTech in The Hague in October 2023. What struck me most, and what I have tried to convey in this thesis, was the powerful dialogue and collective spirit striving to harness the potential of our (digital) heritage. With a sense of conviction after this conference, I approached the next one in Geneva in February 2024 with confidence, believing that I had made a compelling case for the concept of LOUD. When a participant asked how LOUD differed from Linked Data, however, I found myself explaining the socio-technical ethos of IIIF and Linked Art, the richness of the individuals who make them up, the ability to combine these different standards, and the common use cases that emerge from these collaborations. Whether my answer was convincing remains uncertain, but I knew it was too brief. Perhaps it is here, in this conclusion, that my thoughts can find their full expression. I believe that LOUD should be at the forefront of efforts to improve the accessibility and usability of CH data, an endeavour that is increasingly relevant in a web-centric environment. This paradigm has gained considerable traction, particularly with the advent of Linked Art and the recognition that the IIIF Presentation API has been an inspiration for the LOUD design principles. The development and maintenance of LOUD standards by dedicated communities are characterised by collaboration, consensus building, and transparency. In the interstices of the IIIF and Linked Art communities, frameworks for interoperability are not only exposed, but revealed as profound testaments to the power of transparent collaboration across institutional boundaries. Both communities, it is true, are still very much Anglo-Saxon efforts, where the specifications have mainly been implemented in GLAM and/or DH research projects, or at least when we have been aware of them. It has clear guidelines on how to propose use cases, mostly using GitHub, and hides the sometimes unnecessary RDF complexity behind a set of JSON-LD @ context. IIIF is at the presentation layer and can really play its role as a mediator, with the Manifest as its central unit connecting other specifications, including semantic metadata, and preferably with simpatico specifications such as Linked Art. An important hypothesis arises from the observation that adherence to the LOUD design principles makes specifications more likely to be adopted. The primary benefit of adopting LOUD standards lies in their grassroots nature. This grassroots approach not only aligns with the core values of openness and collaboration within the DH community but also serves as a common denominator between DH practitioners and CHIs. This unique alignment fosters a sense of shared purpose and common ground. However, it‚Äôs essential to acknowledge that while LOUD and its associated standards, including IIIF, hold immense promise, their limited recognition in the wider socio-technical ecosystem may currently hinder their full potential impact beyond the CH domain. Consideration of socio-technical requirements and the promotion of digital equity are essential to the development of specifications in line with the LOUD design principles. In the context of the IIIF and Linked Art communities, this means both recognising current challenges and building on existing practices. This includes forming alliances that support diverse forms of inclusion at both project and individual levels. For example, organisations should be encouraged to send representatives from diverse professional and personal backgrounds, such as underrepresented groups or non-technical fields. This can be facilitated by initiatives that lower the barriers to participation, such as financial support for travel and participation, flexible participation formats, and targeted outreach efforts. Furthermore, as these standards often align with open government data initiatives, they present opportunities for broader public engagement and institutional transparency. In the broader context of DH, understanding LOUD involves tracing the historical development of the field and its evolving relationship with technology. The interdisciplinary nature of DH has always integrated diverse scholarly and technical practices. In recent years, DH has seen a notable increase in interest in the use of Linked Data and semantic technologies to improve the discoverability and accessibility of CH collections. LOUD's emphasis on user-centred design and usability aligns well with these goals. Consequently, the principles of LOUD hold great promise for advancing the integration and use of community-driven APIs and/or Linked Data within DH. This can be seen within PIA, where the benefits of implementing IIIF helped us to streamline machine-generated annotations, integrate different thumbnails into GUI prototypes, model photo albums with different layers from the Kreis Family collection, and enable project members and students to engage in digital storytelling, an important participatory facet that can be seamlessly explored by DH efforts and CHIs with the help of the IIIF Image and Presentation APIs. Data reuse is definitely a key LOUD driver, which could have been done more extensively with a productive instance of Linked Art. As for widening participation, this is definitely a strategic and political decision, rather than a technical one. That said, LOUD specifications can definitely be embedded through strategic citizen science initiatives. A recent example that highlights the comprehensive value of Linked Data was presented by @newbury_linked_2024 at the CNI Spring 2024 Meeting. He delineated its significance as extending well beyond single entities, such as the Getty Research Institute, to enrich a vast ecosystem. Specifically, he identified three principal areas of value: Firstly, within the ecosystem itself, where the utility of information is amplified through its application in diverse contexts. Secondly, for the audience, by directly addressing user needs and facilitating various conceptual frameworks. And finally, within the community, by enabling wider use and adaptation of data and code. This approach to Linked Data, as articulated by Newbury, not only enhances its utility across these dimensions, but also aligns seamlessly with the LOUD proposition, underscoring a shared vision for a digital space where the interconnectedness and accessibility of (meta)data serve as foundational principles for progress and community engagement. LUX, as a catalyst for LOUD, exemplifies a practical approach to implementing Linked Data that has garnered significant local engagement and support at Yale. This initiative demonstrates how sound socio-technical practices can be effectively applied within a supportive institutional environment. The consistency of the data within LUX aligns well with IIIF and Linked Art standards, with only a few minor adjustments required for full compliance. These quick fixes are manageable and do not detract from the overall robustness of the initiative. While it may be too early to fully assess the wider impact of using LOUD specifications on the LUX platform within the CH domain, the initiative has already attracted considerable interest in recent months. This growing attention suggests that the LUX approach is resonating with other organisations, suggesting the potential for wider adoption and impact. The enthusiastic local engagement at Yale provides a strong foundation for LUX and highlights its potential to serve as a model for similar projects aimed at enriching digital heritage through effective collaboration and agreed-upon standards. In carrying out this thesis, I have adhered to the five main objectives set out at the beginning of the PhD. These objectives have been accomplished to a high degree, reflecting a substantial and well-executed project. Furthermore, most of the outputs ‚Äì such as data models and scripts ‚Äì from this work are available on GitHub, providing open access to the wider community. In addition, I have published several papers, both individually and collaboratively, further disseminating the findings and contributions of this research. Additionally, this thesis is relevant because it sheds light on communities and implementations that can be celebrated not only for their standards but also for their operating ethos; IIIF and Linked Art present models ripe for emulation beyond their immediate digital confines. Here, agency and authority are most typically granted to the collective over the isolated, with each actor - be it an individual, an institution or an interface ‚Äì intricately interconnected. Yale‚Äôs LUX initiative also embodies this ethos, demonstrating how collaborative efforts can lead to innovative solutions and wider impact. It is to be hoped, then, that these practices of openness and multiple partnerships will not be seen as limited to their origins in digital representation. At the very least, I hope that these socio-technical approaches can serve as exemplars or sources of inspiration in broader arenas, where the principles of mutual visibility and concerted action can point the way towards cohesive and adaptive collaborative architectures. Despite its contribution, this thesis is far from perfect and certainly contains several shortcomings. I will name here three significant ones. First, the visualisations included and the use of FOL are primarily designed to support my own self-reflection and may be more beneficial to me than to the broader academic community. While they provide insights into my research process and findings, their applicability and usefulness to others might be limited. Second, the theoretical framework I employed, while instrumental to my research, may not serve as a universally applicable toolbox. Nevertheless, I urge readers to pay close attention to STS methodologies and practices. The works of Bruno Latour, Donna Haraway, and Susan Leigh Star have been invaluable companions throughout this dissertation. Additionally, for those involved in conceptualising semantic information, I recommend exploring Floridi‚Äôs PI, which offers profound insights into the nature and dynamics of information. These readings have greatly influenced my approach and understanding, and I believe they can offer valuable perspectives to others as well. Third, while the thesis aims to address both community practices and semantic interoperability, it leans more heavily towards the former. This emphasis on community practices may overshadow the broader discussion of semantic interoperability, potentially limiting the appeal of the thesis to those primarily interested in the technical aspects. Other shortcomings include the broad scope of the thesis, with three empirical chapters exploring different avenues. While this comprehensive approach provides a broad understanding of the research topic, it has also resulted in a rather lengthy thesis. This may be a challenge for the reader, as a topic of interest in one chapter may not be as compelling in another. The diversity of empirical focus, while enriching the research, may dilute the coherence for some readers, making it more difficult to maintain a consistent engagement throughout the dissertation. Despite these limitations, I hope that the different perspectives and findings contribute to a richer, more nuanced understanding of LOUD for CH. Avenues for future research are numerous and promising. One interesting area to explore is the comparative benefits experienced by early adopters of IIIF and Linked Art specifications versus those who implemented these standards later. Early adopters have the advantage of having their use cases discussed and resolved within the community, and it would be insightful to analyse the long-term impacts on their projects. Such a study is already feasible for early adopters of IIIF and will become possible to compare further implementations of Linked Art within a few years. Furthermore, future exploration could focus on the full implementation of Linked Art within PIA or similar efforts, as well as more performance-oriented testing with the deployed LOUD APIs. These efforts should further validate the robustness and scalability of these specifications. Another important area for future investigation is the participation of institutions and individuals from the Global South in both the IIIF and Linked Art communities. It is crucial to explore how we can better support their uptake of these specifications and encourage their active involvement in these initiatives to ensure a more inclusive and globally representative environment. As I reflect on the journey of this thesis, I am reminded of the powerful dialogue and collective effort that has been at its heart. Mr Gee‚Äôs poem resonates deeply with my own aspirations for this work: to enhance our understanding of the past through openness and collaboration, as can be seen in IIIF and Linked Art. As I bring this dissertation to a close, I am filled with a sense of accomplishment and a renewed commitment to promoting sound socio-technical practices. It is my hope that the insights and methodologies presented here will inspire others to engage in this ongoing dialogue, continually asking and answering the many questions that arise as we collectively explore our cultural heritage landscapes.
