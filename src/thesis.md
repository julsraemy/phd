title: "Linked Open Usable Data for Cultural Heritage: Perspectives on Community Practices and Semantic Interoperability"
description: "This doctoral thesis explores the impact of digital technologies on the accessibility and engagement with cultural heritage (CH) collections, focusing on web standards known as Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) specifications.

## Abstract

This doctoral thesis explores the impact of digital technologies on the accessibility and engagement with cultural heritage (CH) collections, focusing on web standards known as [Linked Open Usable Data](loud.html) (LOUD) specifications. These include the [International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) Presentation API 3.0](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/), [Linked Art](https://linked.art), and the [W3C Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/), which have been developed to facilitate the description and dissemination of CH resources. Despite the widespread adoption of IIIF, the implementation of LOUD specifications, particularly when used in combination, presents significant challenges, especially in developing and assessing the infrastructures that support these standards.

The research is guided by two primary perspectives: community practices and semantic interoperability. The first examines how organisations, individuals, and tools contribute to the consensus-making processes within the LOUD ecosystem, offering insights into the social structures that underpin these practices. The second perspective explores how data can be standardised and made interoperable to ensure meaningful machine-readable information, facilitating well-formed data exchange. This work is part of the [SNSF-funded research project Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives](pia.html) (PIA) (2021-2025), which aims to develop a citizen science platform around three photographic collections from the archives of Cultural Anthropology Switzerland (CAS). The theoretical framework is firmly rooted in Actor-Network Theory (ANT), with the thesis aiming to describe the collaborative structures of the LOUD ecosystem and highlight the role of non-human actors.

Beyond the implementation of LOUD standards within the PIA research project, the empirical research includes an analysis of the social structures within the IIIF and Linked Art communities, as well as an investigation of [LUX, Yale Collections Discovery](https://lux.collections.yale.edu/) platform. This research seeks to identify the socio-technical requirements for developing specifications that align with LOUD design principles. Additionally, it examines how implementing LOUD standards within PIA reveals their potential benefits and limitations in facilitating data reuse and broader participation. The thesis also delves into Yale University's large-scale deployment of LOUD standards, focusing on the consistency of Linked Art and IIIF resources within the LUX platform and their contribution to the CH domain.

The methodology employed in this thesis is an actor and practice-centred inquiry, offering a detailed examination of specific cosmologies within LOUD-driven communities, PIA, and LUX. This approach seeks to uncover the intricate cultural processes and constellations through a micro-perspective, enriched by empirical evidence.

Key findings indicate that LOUD improves the discoverability and integration of CH data, requiring community-driven consensus on model interoperability. Significant challenges include engaging marginalised groups, sustaining long-term participation, and balancing technological and social factors. While LOUD presents opportunities for improving digital materiality and strategic technology use, it also poses challenges related to resource investment, data consistency, and the broader implementation of complex patterns.

LOUD should lead efforts to enhance the accessibility and usability of CH data. The community-driven approaches of IIIF and Linked Art foster collaboration and transparency, making these standards essential tools in the ongoing evolution of data management. Even for projects and institutions that do not adopt these specifications, LOUD's socio-technical practices offer valuable insights into effective digital stewardship and community engagement strategies.
