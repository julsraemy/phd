## Abstract {id="abstract"}

Digital technologies have fundamentally transformed how Cultural Heritage (CH) collections are accessed and engaged with. [Linked Open Usable Data](loud.html) ({{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }}) specifications, including the [International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) Presentation API 3.0](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/), [Linked Art](https://linked.art), and the [W3C Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/), have emerged as web standards to facilitate the description and dissemination of these valuable resources. Despite the widespread adoption of {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }}, implementing {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} specifications, particularly in combination, remains challenging. This is especially evident in the development and assessment of infrastructures, or sites of assemblage, that support these standards.

This research is guided by two perspectives: community practices and semantic interoperability. The first perspective assesses how organizations, individuals, and apparatuses engage with and contribute to the consensus-making processes surrounding {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }}. By examining these practices, the social fabrics of the {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} ecosystem can be better understood. The second perspective focuses on making data meaningful to machines in a standardized, interoperable manner that promotes the exchange of well-formed information. This research is grounded in the {{ "SNSF" | abbr | safe }}-funded project, [Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives](pia.html) ({{ "PIA" | abbr | safe }}) (2021–2025), which aims to develop a citizen science platform for three photographic collections from the Cultural Anthropology Switzerland ({{ "CAS" | abbr | safe }}) archives. Actor-Network Theory ({{ "ANT" | abbr | safe }}) forms the theoretical foundation, aiming to describe the collaborative structures of the {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} ecosystem and emphasize the role of non-human actors.

Beyond its implementation within the {{ "PIA" | abbr | safe }} project, this research includes an analysis of the social dynamics within the {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} and Linked Art communities and an investigation of Yale's Collections Discovery platform, [LUX](https://lux.collections.yale.edu/). The research identifies socio-technical requirements for developing specifications aligned with {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} principles. It also examines how the implementation of {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} standards in {{ "PIA" | abbr | safe }} highlights their potential benefits and limitations in facilitating data reuse and broader participation. Additionally, it explores Yale University's large-scale deployment of {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} standards, emphasizing the importance of ensuring consistency between Linked Art and {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} resources within the LUX platform for the {{ "CH" | abbr | safe }} domain.

The core methodology of this thesis is an actor- and practice-centered inquiry, focusing on a detailed examination of specific cosmologies within {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }}-driven communities, {{ "PIA" | abbr | safe }}, and LUX. This micro-perspective approach provides rich empirical evidence to unravel the intricate web of cultural processes and constellations in these contexts.

Key empirical findings indicate that {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} enhances the discoverability and integration of data in {{ "CH" | abbr | safe }}, requiring community-driven consensus on model interoperability.

{{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} should lead efforts to improve the accessibility and usability of {{ "CH" | abbr | safe }} data. The community-driven methodologies of {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} and Linked Art inherently foster collaboration and transparency, making these standards essential tools in evolving data management practices.

## 1. Introduction {id="cha:intro"}

Since its inception in 2011, the {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} has revolutionised[^1] the accessibility of image-based resources. Initially driven by the needs of manuscript scholars, {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} focused on two-dimensional images, but has since expanded to encompass a wide range of image-based resources, including audiovisual materials and, in the near future, {{ "3D" | abbr | safe }} images. Similarly, Linked Art, formally established in 2017, initially concentrated on art museum objects but has since broadened its scope to model a variety of {{ "CH" | abbr | safe }} entities, leveraging {{ "CIDOC-CRM" | abbr | safe }}, a renowned ontology in the museum and {{ "DH" | abbr | safe }} space. Both initiatives aim to break down silos: {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} focuses on improving the presentation of digital objects, while both initiatives enhance their dissemination. Together, they make {{ "CH" | abbr | safe }} data more accessible through {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} and more meaningful through Linked Art for machines. These efforts have primarily benefited the {{ "CH" | abbr | safe }} domain. 

A key commonality is that the main {{ "API" | abbr | safe }}s these communities create align with the {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} design principles, either intentionally or empirically demonstrated through use cases. These principles enable software developers to develop compliant tools and services without needing to fully understand {{ "RDF" | abbr | safe }}, a syntax for representing information on the web. Additionally, they may not need to grasp all {{ "LOD" | abbr | safe }} principles, which promote the interlinking of data from diverse datasets using tools like {{ "KOS" | abbr | safe }} such as thesauri. {{ "WADM" | abbr | safe }}, a {{ "W3C" | abbr | safe }} standard, is also recognised as a {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} specification. It provides a framework for creating interoperable annotations on web resources, facilitating the linking and sharing of data across different platforms and applications. These {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} design principles include the right abstraction for the audience, few barriers to entry, comprehensibility by introspection, documentation with working examples, and the use of many consistent patterns rather than few exceptions. Additionally, both {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} and Linked Art are driven by vibrant communities, mainly comprising {{ "GLAM" | abbr | safe }} and higher education institutions. 

While the standards and principles discussed have broad applications, it is important to clarify the scope of this dissertation. This work does not focus on {{ "KG" | abbr | safe }}s by assessing triplestores -- databases specifically designed to store and retrieve triples, which are the fundamental data structures in {{ "RDF" | abbr | safe }}. Similarly, it does not deal with evaluating {{ "SPARQL" | abbr | safe }} engines, which are specifically designed to query {{ "KG" | abbr | safe }}s. Additionally, this dissertation does not address the intersection of {{ "ML" | abbr | safe }} and {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }}, or the ontological reasoning of Linked Art. 

Instead, this dissertation concentrates on {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }}, the consistency of its standards, design principles and the vibrant communities behind it. It examines {{ "JSON-LD" | abbr | safe }} serialisation efforts and the crucial intersection required to establish robust semantic interoperability baselines between presentation and semantic layers. It also presents real-world use case implementations, both on a small scale in a laboratory and flexible space within the {{ "PIA" | abbr | safe }} research project, and on a large scale at Yale, exemplified by the LUX platform that provides access to (meta)data from {{ "YUL" | abbr | safe }}, {{ "YCBA" | abbr | safe }}, {{ "YUAG" | abbr | safe }}, and {{ "YPM" | abbr | safe }}. 

The focus is therefore on digital infrastructures capable of delivering {{ "JSON-LD" | abbr | safe }} files from the above specifications, which are primarily, though not exclusively, {{ "CH" | abbr | safe }} resources. It is more about the different actors -- both human and non-human -- that create and maintain these interconnected systems and the dynamic interactions that sustain them. The deployment of various {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} specifications addresses the need for semantic interoperability between {{ "CH" | abbr | safe }} resources and disparate datasets by establishing a standardised approach to representing and linking data, ensuring that information can be seamlessly shared and understood across different platforms and contexts. 

This dissertation seeks to carve out a distinct niche by addressing an often-overlooked aspect of {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} and Linked Art. {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} is sometimes perceived and studied merely as a service or an appendix, with the content it delivers taking precedence. However, this PhD thesis positions {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} as a first-class citizen worthy of in-depth study. Similarly, Linked Art, despite its potential and its relatively recent establishment, has been the subject of very few scholarly papers. This gap underscores the significance of {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} in this context. Furthermore, this thesis elevates Linked Art to a position of primary importance, recognising its significance and advocating for its thorough examination. To thoroughly study {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} and its adherence to design principles, it is essential to immerse ourselves actively in both communities -- an approach I have embraced for years. The thesis also emphasises the importance of participatory efforts and collaboration between research projects, which typically have shorter lifespans, and memory institutions, which need to implement technical standards as a *lingua franca*. In doing so, it reveals the mediating role of {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} in advancing the heritage sphere. To truly understand {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }}, Linked Art, and to a lesser extent {{ "WADM" | abbr | safe }}, it is crucial to examine the social fabrics and consensus decision-making of each community. Among these considerations are how the specifications can be implemented pragmatically, and how the standards can support the implementation and maintenance of more extensive semantic interoperability efforts. 

The significance of this research lies in highlighting the commitment and diligence of the individuals and organisations that make up both the {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} and Linked Art communities. It aims to demonstrate that community-driven practices, such as those exemplified by {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} and Linked Art, have a potential that goes beyond the mere sharing of digital objects and their associated metadata. The more people who embrace these approaches and implement the associated specifications, the more society as a whole will benefit. Furthermore, this research illustrates that {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} is no longer limited to two-dimensional images, that Linked Art is not restricted to artworks, and that {{ "WADM" | abbr | safe }} is a simple, content-agnostic standard that can be easily integrated into a range of systems. This adaptability is a strength of {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} standards, which are designed to be simple yet effective. {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} can serve a variety of purposes, primarily rooted in {{ "CH" | abbr | safe }}, but with the potential to extend its benefits to other sectors. The true beauty of {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} lies in its ability to foster networking opportunities and transparent socio-technical practices, demonstrating its value beyond mere technical implementation. 

By emphasising these aspects, this dissertation highlights the wider impact of {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} in promoting semantic interoperability and enhancing collaborative efforts within the heritage field and beyond. In addition, the implementation of standards through {{ "PIA" | abbr | safe }} underlines the potential for similar participatory or citizen science projects, while the LUX initiative serves as an illustrative example of robust infrastructure and cross-unit engagement. These examples demonstrate the practical applications and far-reaching implications of adopting {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} standards in different contexts. 

This dissertation is structured across ten chapters, each building upon the previous ones up to Chapter 5 to provide a comprehensive understanding of the research. These initial chapters lay the foundation of the study, establishing the context, theoretical framework, and methodological approaches. After this foundational section, Chapters 6, 7, and 8 present empirical studies that, while interconnected, can be read independently if desired. These chapters offer detailed insights into specific aspects of the research and can be appreciated on their own or as part of the broader narrative.

The thesis continues with [Chapter 2](#cha:context), which extends this introduction by providing more information about the research setting, specifically {{ "PIA" | abbr | safe }}. [Chapter 3](#cha:literature) follows with an extensive literature review, offering a comprehensive overview of methods to interlink {{ "CH" | abbr | safe }} data. Next, [Chapter 4](#cha:theoretical) presents the theoretical framework, conceptualised as a toolbox and firmly rooted in {{ "ANT" | abbr | safe }}, guiding the analysis and discussion throughout the dissertation. Following this, [Chapter 5](#cha:scope) details the research scope and methodology, explaining the approaches and methods employed in the study.

Moving on to the empirical work, [Chapter 6](#cha:social-fabrics) sheds light on the social fabrics of {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} and Linked Art, exploring the communities and practices that underpin these initiatives.[Chapter 7](#cha:pia-laboratory) then examines the implementation of {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} standards
within {{ "PIA" | abbr | safe }}, highlighting the practical aspects and challenges encountered. This is followed by [Chapter 8](#cha:lux-consistency), which focuses on the LUX initiative at Yale, examining the underlying governance and interdepartmental ownership of the Yale Collections Discovery platform. The discussion of findings is presented in [Chapter 9](#cha:discussion), where the results from the empirical chapters are synthesised and analysed in relation to the theoretical framework. Finally, [Chapter 10](#cha:conclusion) concludes
the thesis, summarising the key insights and contributions of the
research while outlining potential directions for future study.

## 2. Context {id="cha:context"}

In this chapter, I will set the stage for my PhD thesis by providing important background information. First, in , I will explain why I chose the title for my thesis. This will give you an understanding of the main focus and the direction of my research. Next, in , I will describe the {{ "PIA" | abbr | safe }} research project, which is central to my work. This section will cover the project's goals, significance, and overall framework. In , I will detail my specific contributions to the {{ "PIA" | abbr | safe }} project. I will emphasise how my work fits into the larger project and its importance to my thesis. Finally, in , I will talk about my active participation in the {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} and Linked Art communities. This section will highlight how my involvement in these communities has influenced my research and its broader implications.

### 2.1 PhD Title

I chose the title as it encapsulates the essence of my research focus but I could have indeed chosen other ones.

During the initial stages of my research, multiple working titles were explored to capture the diverse facets of my interests and objectives. If I was quite sure about having in the title after the third iteration, I was quite unsure of what should follow and if a subtitle was actually needed at all. Amidst this dynamic progression, the underlying theme of my research remained steadfast -- to delve into the transformative potential of {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} for {{ "CH" | abbr | safe }}.

I also opted to maintain in the title of my thesis subsection. While holds its appeal, my choice reflects a broader narrative that acknowledges the crucial role of {{ "CHI" | abbr | safe }}s and spotlighting the multifaceted nature of heritage preservation, encapsulating both its digital facets and the essential contribution of individuals and institutions in curating, interpreting, and making heritage accessible. 

As for the subtitle, while I do explore {{ "CoP" | abbr | safe }} as defined by @lave_situated_1991 and @wenger_communities_2011 through investigating the social fabrics of the {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} and Linked Art communities, my main interest lies in the broader application of {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} for describing and interlinking {{ "CH" | abbr | safe }} resources. Thus, I decided to opt for the more generic as the first axis or perspective. 

For the second perspective, I wanted to see how semantic interoperability can be achieved through standards adhering to the {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} design principles, as they seem to be key enablers for seamless collaboration and knowledge exchange among practitioners. There was a time in my research when I envisaged decoupling and , perceiving them as two distinct dimensions. However, what really captivates me is the unification of these factors to facilitate collective reasoning for both humans and machines. 

In summary, this title reflects my enthusiasm for using web-based and community-driven technologies to transform the way we understand, share and value {{ "CH" | abbr | safe }}.

    [@mr_gee_day_2023]

This chapter brings to a close the journey undertaken since February 2021, aiming to clearly articulate the answers to the research questions, discuss how the research aligns with the objectives, elucidate the significance of the work, outline its shortcomings, and suggest avenues for future research. 

I had the privilege of hearing the above poem at EuropeanaTech in The Hague in October 2023. What struck me most, and what I have tried to convey in this thesis, was the powerful dialogue and collective spirit striving to harness the potential of our (digital) heritage. With a sense of conviction after this conference, I approached the next one in Geneva in February 2024 with confidence, believing that I had made a compelling case for the concept of {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }}. When a participant asked how {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} differed from Linked Data, however, I found myself explaining the socio-technical ethos of {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} and Linked Art, the richness of the individuals who make them up, the ability to combine these different standards, and the common use cases that emerge from these collaborations. Whether my answer was convincing remains uncertain, but I knew it was too brief. Perhaps it is here, in this conclusion, that my thoughts can find their full expression. 

I believe that {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} should be at the forefront of efforts to improve the accessibility and usability of {{ "CH" | abbr | safe }} data, an endeavour that is increasingly relevant in a web-centric environment. This paradigm has gained considerable traction, particularly with the advent of Linked Art and the recognition that the {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} Presentation {{ "API" | abbr | safe }} has been an inspiration for the {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} design principles. The development and maintenance of {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} standards by dedicated communities are characterised by collaboration, consensus building, and transparency. In the interstices of the {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} and Linked Art communities, frameworks for interoperability are not only exposed, but revealed as profound testaments to the power of transparent collaboration across institutional boundaries. Both communities, it is true, are still very much Anglo-Saxon efforts, where the specifications have mainly been implemented in {{ "GLAM" | abbr | safe }} and/or {{ "DH" | abbr | safe }} research projects, or at least when we have been aware of them. It has clear guidelines on how to propose use cases, mostly using GitHub, and hides the sometimes unnecessary {{ "RDF" | abbr | safe }} complexity behind a set of {{ "JSON-LD" | abbr | safe }} `@ context`. {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} is at the presentation layer and can really play its role as a mediator, with the Manifest as its central unit connecting other specifications, including semantic metadata, and preferably with simpatico specifications such as Linked Art. 

An important hypothesis arises from the observation that adherence to the {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} design principles makes specifications more likely to be adopted. The primary benefit of adopting {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} standards lies in their grassroots nature. This grassroots approach not only aligns with the core values of openness and collaboration within the {{ "DH" | abbr | safe }} community but also serves as a common denominator between {{ "DH" | abbr | safe }} practitioners and {{ "CHI" | abbr | safe }}s. This unique alignment fosters a sense of shared purpose and common ground. However, it's essential to acknowledge that while {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} and its associated standards, including IIIF, hold immense promise, their limited recognition in the wider socio-technical ecosystem may currently hinder their full potential impact beyond the {{ "CH" | abbr | safe }} domain. 

Consideration of socio-technical requirements and the promotion of digital equity are essential to the development of specifications in line with the {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} design principles. In the context of the {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} and Linked Art communities, this means both recognising current challenges and building on existing practices. This includes forming alliances that support diverse forms of inclusion at both project and individual levels. For example, organisations should be encouraged to send representatives from diverse professional and personal backgrounds, such as underrepresented groups or non-technical fields. This can be facilitated by initiatives that lower the barriers to participation, such as financial support for travel and participation, flexible participation formats, and targeted outreach efforts. Furthermore, as these standards often align with open government data initiatives, they present opportunities for broader public engagement and institutional transparency. 

In the broader context of {{ "DH" | abbr | safe }}, understanding {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} involves tracing the historical development of the field and its evolving relationship with technology. The interdisciplinary nature of {{ "DH" | abbr | safe }} has always integrated diverse scholarly and technical practices. In recent years, {{ "DH" | abbr | safe }} has seen a notable increase in interest in the use of Linked Data and semantic technologies to improve the discoverability and accessibility of {{ "CH" | abbr | safe }} collections. {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }}'s emphasis on user-centred design and usability aligns well with these goals. Consequently, the principles of {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} hold great promise for advancing the integration and use of community-driven {{ "API" | abbr | safe }}s and/or Linked Data within {{ "DH" | abbr | safe }}. This can be seen within {{ "PIA" | abbr | safe }}, where the benefits of implementing {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} helped us to streamline machine-generated annotations, integrate different thumbnails into {{ "GUI" | abbr | safe }} prototypes, model photo albums with different layers from the Kreis Family collection, and enable project members and students to engage in digital storytelling, an important participatory facet that can be seamlessly explored by {{ "DH" | abbr | safe }} efforts and {{ "CHI" | abbr | safe }}s with the help of the {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} Image and Presentation {{ "API" | abbr | safe }}s. Data reuse is definitely a key {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} driver, which could have been done more extensively with a productive instance of Linked Art. As for widening participation, this is definitely a strategic and political decision, rather than a technical one. That said, {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} specifications can definitely be embedded through strategic citizen science initiatives. 

A recent example that highlights the comprehensive value of Linked Data was presented by @newbury_linked_2024 at the {{ "CNI" | abbr | safe }} Spring 2024 Meeting. He delineated its significance as extending well beyond single entities, such as the Getty Research Institute, to enrich a vast ecosystem. Specifically, he identified three principal areas of value: Firstly, within the ecosystem itself, where the utility of information is amplified through its application in diverse contexts. Secondly, for the audience, by directly addressing user needs and facilitating various conceptual frameworks. And finally, within the community, by enabling wider use and adaptation of data and code. This approach to Linked Data, as articulated by Newbury, not only enhances its utility across these dimensions, but also aligns seamlessly with the {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} proposition, underscoring a shared vision for a digital space where the interconnectedness and accessibility of (meta)data serve as foundational principles for progress and community engagement. 

LUX, as a catalyst for {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }}, exemplifies a practical approach to implementing Linked Data that has garnered significant local engagement and support at Yale. This initiative demonstrates how sound socio-technical practices can be effectively applied within a supportive institutional environment. The consistency of the data within LUX aligns well with {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} and Linked Art standards, with only a few minor adjustments required for full compliance. These quick fixes are manageable and do not detract from the overall robustness of the initiative. While it may be too early to fully assess the wider impact of using {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} specifications on the LUX platform within the {{ "CH" | abbr | safe }} domain, the initiative has already attracted considerable interest in recent months. This growing attention suggests that the LUX approach is resonating with other organisations, suggesting the potential for wider adoption and impact. The enthusiastic local engagement at Yale provides a strong foundation for LUX and highlights its potential to serve as a model for similar projects aimed at enriching digital heritage through effective collaboration and agreed-upon standards. 

In carrying out this thesis, I have adhered to the five main objectives set out at the beginning of the PhD. These objectives have been accomplished to a high degree, reflecting a substantial and well-executed project. Furthermore, most of the outputs -- such as data models and scripts -- from this work are available on GitHub, providing open access to the wider community. In addition, I have published several papers, both individually and collaboratively, further disseminating the findings and contributions of this research. 

Additionally, this thesis is relevant because it sheds light on communities and implementations that can be celebrated not only for their standards but also for their operating ethos; {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} and Linked Art present models ripe for emulation beyond their immediate digital confines. Here, agency and authority are most typically granted to the collective over the isolated, with each actor - be it an individual, an institution or an interface -- intricately interconnected. Yale's LUX initiative also embodies this ethos, demonstrating how collaborative efforts can lead to innovative solutions and wider impact. It is to be hoped, then, that these practices of openness and multiple partnerships will not be seen as limited to their origins in digital representation. At the very least, I hope that these socio-technical approaches can serve as exemplars or sources of inspiration in broader arenas, where the principles of mutual visibility and concerted action can point the way towards cohesive and adaptive collaborative architectures. 

Despite its contribution, this thesis is far from perfect and certainly contains several shortcomings. I will name here three significant ones. First, the visualisations included and the use of {{ "FOL" | abbr | safe }} are primarily designed to support my own self-reflection and may be more beneficial to me than to the broader academic community. While they provide insights into my research process and findings, their applicability and usefulness to others might be limited. Second, the theoretical framework I employed, while instrumental to my research, may not serve as a universally applicable toolbox. Nevertheless, I urge readers to pay close attention to {{ "STS" | abbr | safe }} methodologies and practices. The works of Bruno Latour, Donna Haraway, and Susan Leigh Star have been invaluable companions throughout this dissertation. Additionally, for those involved in conceptualising semantic information, I recommend exploring Floridi's {{ "PI" | abbr | safe }}, which offers profound insights into the nature and dynamics of information. These readings have greatly influenced my approach and understanding, and I believe they can offer valuable perspectives to others as well. Third, while the thesis aims to address both community practices and semantic interoperability, it leans more heavily towards the former. This emphasis on community practices may overshadow the broader discussion of semantic interoperability, potentially limiting the appeal of the thesis to those primarily interested in the technical aspects. 

Other shortcomings include the broad scope of the thesis, with three empirical chapters exploring different avenues. While this comprehensive approach provides a broad understanding of the research topic, it has also resulted in a rather lengthy thesis. This may be a challenge for the reader, as a topic of interest in one chapter may not be as compelling in another. The diversity of empirical focus, while enriching the research, may dilute the coherence for some readers, making it more difficult to maintain a consistent engagement throughout the dissertation. Despite these limitations, I hope that the different perspectives and findings contribute to a richer, more nuanced understanding of {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} for {{ "CH" | abbr | safe }}. 

Avenues for future research are numerous and promising. One interesting area to explore is the comparative benefits experienced by early adopters of {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} and Linked Art specifications versus those who implemented these standards later. Early adopters have the advantage of having their use cases discussed and resolved within the community, and it would be insightful to analyse the long-term impacts on their projects. Such a study is already feasible for early adopters of {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} and will become possible to compare further implementations of Linked Art within a few years. Furthermore, future exploration could focus on the full implementation of Linked Art within {{ "PIA" | abbr | safe }} or similar efforts, as well as more performance-oriented testing with the deployed {{ "LOUD" | abbr | safe }} {{ "API" | abbr | safe }}s. These efforts should further validate the robustness and scalability of these specifications. Another important area for future investigation is the participation of institutions and individuals from the Global South in both the {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} and Linked Art communities. It is crucial to explore how we can better support their uptake of these specifications and encourage their active involvement in these initiatives to ensure a more inclusive and globally representative environment. 

As I reflect on the journey of this thesis, I am reminded of the powerful dialogue and collective effort that has been at its heart. Mr Gee's poem resonates deeply with my own aspirations for this work: to enhance our understanding of the past through openness and collaboration, as can be seen in {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} and Linked Art. As I bring this dissertation to a close, I am filled with a sense of accomplishment and a renewed commitment to promoting sound socio-technical practices. It is my hope that the insights and methodologies presented here will inspire others to engage in this ongoing dialogue, continually asking and answering the many questions that arise as we collectively explore our cultural heritage landscapes.

[^116]: {{ "FOL" | abbr | safe }}, also
    known as first-order predicate logic or first-order predicate
    calculus, is a formal system of symbolic logic used in mathematics,
    philosophy, and computer science. It is a logical framework for
    expressing and reasoning about statements involving objects and
    their properties and relationships. In {{ "FOL" | abbr | safe }}, statements are represented using
    variables, constants, functions, and predicates. It allows for the
    quantification of variables and the formulation of statements such
    as $\forall$ (for all) and $\exists$ (there exists), which enable
    the expression of universal and existential quantification. As such,
    {{ "FOL" | abbr | safe }} can express
    facts concerning some or all of the objects in the universe. Its
    epistemological commitment, i.e. what an agent believes about facts,
    is concentrated of what is true, false, or unknown\

[^239]: Bourdieu's theory of fields conceptualises social life as a

    rules, structures and forms of capital. Actors within these fields
    compete for dominance, status and resources, guided by both their
    and the specific capital they possess.

[^242]: In the earlier days of the {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} community, there was much more
    fluidity in terms of roles and responsibilities, especially within

[^253]: For one of these face-to-face meetings, documentation was
    produced daily over four days, resulting in four distinct meeting
    records. Therefore, while only five face-to-face gatherings
    occurred, they account for eight entries in the total of 115
    meetings documented.

    {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }}
    specifications, available at
    <https://iiif.io/news/2020/06/04/IIIF-C-Announces-Final-Release-of-3.0-Specifications/>

[^256]: The {{ "TRC" | abbr | safe }}
    includes a distinct group of *ex officio* members alongside IIIF-C
    representatives and up to five community representatives. As of May
    2020, {{ "IIIF-C" | abbr | safe }}
    comprised 58 member institutions. Despite the significance of the
    issue at hand, less than half of the eligible voting members,
    totalling 30, participated in this decision-making process, which
    can take place asynchronously and as late as two weeks after the
    meeting.

[^257]: An example of deviation from the {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} specifications can be seen in the
    *Digitaler Lesesaal* of the archives of Basel-Stadt and St. Gallen.
    Despite their efforts to implement {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} within their systems [see
    @kansy_going_2022], there are technical challenges that could hinder
    the accessibility of {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} Manifests beyond their portals. Key
    issues include non-compliant {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} Manifests, problematic
    {{ "CORS" | abbr | safe }} header
    configurations, and the way in which {{ "URI" | abbr | safe }}s are minted, which prevent their use in
    external {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }}
    clients. Such practices not only challenge the core tenets of
    interoperability, but also suggest the need for greater adherence to
    the {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }}
    design principles and the exploration of alternatives that would
    still ensure compliance.

[^259]: A few months after this investigation, Aviary, the Glycerine
    Viewer, Theseus, and the Curation Viewer have been added to the
    support matrix.

[^271]: The survey was being promoted primarily on the Slack workspace
    of both communities, on their respective mailing list, as well as on
    Mastodon [see @raemy_dear_2023].

[^272]: Among the survey respondents, 16 individuals reported
    involvement in both the {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} and Linked Art communities,
    demonstrating a notable cross-community engagement. In addition, 38
    participants were active in either {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} or Linked Art, with a significant
    majority, 36 respondents, aligning themselves with the
    {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }}
    community. In contrast, a much smaller group, only 2 respondents,
    indicated that they were exclusively involved with Linked Art.
    Interestingly, a significant proportion, 25 individuals, indicated
    no affiliation with either community, highlighting the diverse
    levels of engagement and interest within the {{ "CH" | abbr | safe }} field.

    and Linked Art data visualisations, and help to identify entity
    types. It is important to note, however, that the colour coding does
    not reflect mappings to the Knora Base Ontology, as this ontology

[^323]: As mentioned earlier, the Linked Art {{ "API" | abbr | safe }} and the {{ "ETL" | abbr | safe }} pipeline have not been deployed in a
    production environment. Ensuring that these components are fully
    implemented and operational remains an ongoing task that may serve
    as a benchmark for collaboration with other
    {{ "CHI" | abbr | safe }}s.

[^324]: It is anticipated that the {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} Presentation
    {{ "API" | abbr | safe }} 3.0 will
    also be accessible through {{ "DSP" | abbr | safe }}, a development I have been
    coordinating (cf. <https://github.com/dasch-swiss/daschiiify>).
    However, the hosting of machine-generated annotations would still
    require additional infrastructure, and hotlinking could be employed
    so that the annotations remain visible on a given client.

[^326]: Some of these considerations are elements that have been
    discussed on the {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} Slack Workspace technical channel.

[^361]: Although {{ "HTTPS" | abbr | safe }} {{ "URI" | abbr | safe }}s are listed as the and are recommended
    for general usage, the canonical form for machine-readable layers,
    as used in the {{ "IIIF" | abbr | safe }} Presentation API should be
    {{ "HTTP" | abbr | safe }}. This is
    because the Presentation {{ "API" | abbr | safe }}'s enumeration of values is primarily
    software-driven, and thus, the {{ "HTTP" | abbr | safe }} form is considered the canonical form
    for software infrastructures. See
