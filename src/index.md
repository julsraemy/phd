# LOUD for Cultural Heritage â€“ PhD Thesis by Julien A. Raemy

## Linked Open Usable Data for Cultural Heritage: Perspectives on Community Practices and Semantic Interoperability

_"Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) for Cultural Heritage" not only encapsulates the essence of my PhD thesis, it reflects a passionate aspiration. It describes a vision where cultural heritage institutions and beyond actively cultivate collaboration and enthusiastically embrace community-driven standards such as those of the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) and Linked Art which facilitate semantic interoperability. In cases where implementation of the standards may not be feasible, I advocate that institutions consider adopting <a href="https://linked.art/loud" target="_blank">LOUD design principles</a> as essential socio-technical practices._


An [HTML version of my thesis](thesis.html) will be accessible on this site upon its completion, while the [research outcomes](research.html) associated with my PhD can also be found here.


### Context

The thesis is grounded as part of the SNSF-funded Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA) research project (2021-2025), which aims to develop a Citizen Science platform around three <a href="https://archiv.sgv-sstp.ch/" target="_blank">photographic collections from the archives of Cultural Anthropology Switzerland</a> (CAS), formerly the _Swiss Society for Folklore Studies_, i.e. the Atlas of Swiss Folklore (SGV_05), Kreis Family (SGV_10), and Ernst Brunner (SGV_12). 

There is more information about the PIA research project and my involvement therein on [a dedicated page](pia.html).
