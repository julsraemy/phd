PhD Thesis in Digital Humanities supervised by:

- Dr. Robert Sanderson (Yale University)

My PhD focuses on web standards, i.e. Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) specifications (such as the <a href="https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/" target="_blank">IIIF Presentation API 3.0</a>, Linked Art, and the W3C Web Annotation Data Model), supporting the description and dissemination of cultural heritage resources. Two research axes or perspectives have been identified to investigate LOUD, the first axis focusing on community practices, i.e. assessing the mechanisms by which organisations, individuals and apparatuses are entangled in consensus-making, and the second on semantic interoperability, i.e. how to make data meaningful to machines in a standardised and interoperable manner.
 
The theoretical framework is firmly rooted in Actor-Network Theory (ANT), a constructivist approach mainly defined by Bruno Latour, as one of the objectives is to describe the associations between actors and the social fabrics of the LOUD ecosystem as well as to highlight the importance of non-human actors, such as the data models developed within the PIA research project and for my own purposes. Additionally, the theoretical framework is enriched by integrating complementary perspectives from Anna Haraway's Situated Knowledges, Susan Leigh Star's Boundary Objects, and Luciano Floridi's Philosophy of Information. Each of these frameworks contributes uniquely to our understanding of LOUD and its socio-technical landscape.

## Context

The thesis is grounded as part of the SNSF-funded Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA) research project (2021-2025), which aims to develop a Citizen Science platform around three photographic collections from the archives of Cultural Anthropology Switzerland (CAS), formerly the _Swiss Society for Folklore Studies_, namely the Atlas of Swiss Folklore (SGV_05), Kreis Family (SGV_10), and Ernst Brunner (SGV_12).
