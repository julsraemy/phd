    "abstract": "As the web keeps increasing in size, the number of vulnerable and poorly-managed websites increases commensurately. Attackers rely on armies of malicious bots to discover these vulnerable websites, compromising their servers, and exfiltrating sensitive user data. It is, therefore, crucial for the security of the web to understand the population and behavior of malicious bots.In this paper, we report on the design, implementation, and results of Aristaeus, a system for deploying large numbers of \"honeysites\", i.e., websites that exist for the sole purpose of attracting and recording bot traffic. Through a seven-month-long experiment with 100 dedicated honeysites, Aristaeus recorded 26.4 million requests sent by more than 287K unique IP addresses, with 76,396 of them belonging to clearly malicious bots. By analyzing the type of requests and payloads that these bots send, we discover that the average honeysite received more than 37K requests each month, with more than 50% of these requests attempting to brute-force credentials, fingerprint the deployed web applications, and exploit large numbers of different vulnerabilities. By comparing the declared identity of these bots with their TLS handshakes and HTTP headers, we uncover that more than 86.2% of bots are claiming to be Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, yet are built on simple HTTP libraries and command-line tools.",

    "abstract": "Bots may be increasingly capable of emulating individual human behaviors in online survey research. Although effective methods for bot-detection exist, it is unclear whether or not these methods translate for use outside simulation. There are complexities in practical application that complicate the use of statistical methods, as the true number of bot-generated responses must be inferred. This paper presents a preliminary translational model that combines a manual flagging procedure and statistical methods for bot-detection (Mahalanobis distance and person-total correlation). Cases (n = 1306) from a real, bot-corrupted data were sorted via a manual flagging procedure as either “likely bot” (n = 402) or “likely human” (n = 904). Statistical methods for bot-detection were applied. Findings revealed significantly greater Mahalanobis distances among individual responses in the “likely human” group, compared to the “likely bot” group (p < 0.001; r = 0.32); no significant differences were found with person-total-correlation. For both groups, internal consistency was strongly aligned with published human data. Results suggest bots may be increasingly capable of replicating nuanced individual response behaviors in survey data. Authors explore the potential uses and limitations of the proposed model, while emphasizing the importance of improving the translational capacity of bot-detection methods.",

    "abstract": "The article processing charge (APC) financed Open Access is a publication model that provides immediate and free access to scientific articles. More than half of the world’s Open Access articles are published according to this concept. However, a side effect of the model is that research is not published if researchers cannot pay the publication charge. The study examines the nature of this phenomenon, its extent, and implications. The study places a special focus on authors who are not affiliated with a research institution. The proportion of these authors is identified among 2,184 Danish authors in Danish periodicals in 2010. The possibility for poor researchers to receive compensation from publishers is investigated as well. Paying the APC is a problem for many researchers—represented by around 30% of authors who have published in Danish journals (unemployed scientists, students, as well as retired and private employees). Grants from publishers exist, but they are small and too uncertain to ensure that research is published optimally. This study predicts that a large amount of valuable research risks not being published if this publishing model dominates without alternatives or countermeasures.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores how the dynamics and structure of land ownership can be studied by automating the vectorisation of historical cadastral sources. Cadastres are a granular, relatively homogeneous and abundant source. From the 18th century, they are also relatively well aligned with the paradigms of modern geodata. Digital or quantitative methods seem therefore particularly well suited to approach these substantial archival corpora. Our analysis focuses mainly on three cadastres of Lausanne (1722, 1831, 1883), which total 570 plats. The plans are first georeferenced, before being semantically segmented using a neural model, and vectorised. Compared to a manual approach, automation reduces the vectorisation workload by 12 fold. We study the dynamics of persistence by deploying a spatial matching methodology, geometrically detecting parcel fusions and divisions across temporal layers. We also investigate the social structure of ownership in Lausanne at the beginning of the 19th century by relating representative owners to their socioprofessional status based on historical population censuses.",

    "abstract": "The article criticises the neutrality thesis (all technology, AI included is neutral and can be used for good and evil purposes). It argues that it must be replaced by the value double-charge thesis, according to which the design of any technologic is a moral act, no technology is ever neutral, and every technology can have a more or less “static equilibrium” of values, thus being subject to forces that push it in morally evil or good directions. It concludes by arguing that the neutrality thesis hides, while the double-charge thesis discloses, the significant responsibilities involved in finding the right values to be implemented, the trade-offs to be reached, and the policies to be devised when designing, developing, and deploying any technology. This is crucial, especially when the technology in question is as powerful, disruptive, and influential as AI.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we report on efforts to enhance the Swiss persistent identifier (PID) ecosystem. We will firstly describe the current situation and the need for improvement in order to describe in full detail the steps undertaken to create a Swiss-wide model. A case study was undertaken by using several data sets from the domains of art and design in the context of the ICOPAD project. We will provide a set of recommendations to enable a PID service that could mint Archival Resource Key (ARK) identifiers or a flavour of Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs) as complement to Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). We will conclude with some remarks concerning the transferability of this approach to other areas and the requirements for a national hub for PID management in Switzerland.",

    "abstract": "Innovative technologies are improving the accessibility, preservation, and searchability of born-digital and digitised records. In particular, Artificial Intelligence is opening new opportunities for archivists and researchers. However, the experience of scholars (particularly humanities scholars) and other users remain understudied. This article asks how and why researchers and general users are, or are not, using computational methods. This research is informed by an open-call survey, completed by 22 individuals, and semi-structured interviews with 33 professionals, including archivists, librarians, digital humanists, literary scholars, historians, and computer scientists. Drawing on these results, this article offers an analysis of user experiences of computational research methods applied to digitised and born-digital archives. With a focus on humanities and social science researchers, this article also discusses users who resist this kind of research, perhaps because they lack the skills necessary to engage with these materials at scale, or because they prefer to use more traditional methods, such as close reading and historical analysis. Here, we explore the uses of computational and more “traditional” research methodologies applied to digital records. We also make a series of recommendations to elevate users’ computational skills but also to improve the digital infrastructure to make archives more accessible and usable.",

    "abstract": "Yale University has implemented a knowledge graph based discovery system that brings together the various art, natural history, archival, conservation and bibliographic collections using Linked Open Usable Data standards such as Linked Art and IIIF. This system comprises more than 41 million records, which would expand to more than 2 billion RDF triples, and is thus at a similar scale to Europeana. This paper presents the lessons learned from the five year effort around the usability of linked data structures across the organization, the technologies needed to make use of the knowledge in a performant way, and the appropriate design paradigms for front end applications which make the graph easily and intuitively accessible to researchers and the public, including the necessity of consistency in data modeling, that records are an essential concept to maintain through multi-modal systems, and the use of hypertext and web caches to maintain the separation between systems.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we report on efforts to enhance the Swiss persistent identifier (PID) ecosystem. We will firstly describe the current situation and the need for improvement in order to describe in full detail the steps undertaken to create a Swiss-wide model. A case study was undertaken by using several data sets from the domains of art and design in the context of the ICOPAD project. We will provide a set of recommendations to enable a PID service that could mint Archival Resource Key (ARK) identifiers or a flavour of Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs) as complement to Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). We will conclude with some remarks concerning the transferability of this approach to other areas and the requirements for a national hub for PID management in Switzerland.",

Our central result is a virtual image-sound installation that allows the same photographs to be re-imagined in three contrasting acoustic “moods”, based on the argument that family photography’s “show and tell” is an open-ended performance, in which the user of an archival platform is asked to participate.",

    "abstract": "Persistent identifiers (PIDs) are essential for getting access and referring to library, archive and museum (LAM) collection objects in a sustainable and unambiguous way, both internally and externally. Heritage institutions need a universal policy for the use of PIDs in order to have an efficient digital infrastructure at their disposal and to achieve optimal interoperability, leading to open data, open collections and efficient resource management., Here the discussion is limited to PIDs that institutions can assign to objects they own or administer themselves. PIDs for people, subjects etc. can be used by heritage institutions, but are generally managed by other parties., The first part of this article consists of a general theoretical description of persistent identifiers. First of all, I discuss the questions of what persistent identifiers are and what they are not, and what is needed to administer and use them. The most commonly used existing PID systems are briefly characterized. Then I discuss the types of objects PIDs can be assigned to. This section concludes with an overview of the requirements that apply if PIDs should also be used for linked data., The second part examines current infrastructural practices, and existing PID systems and their advantages and shortcomings. Based on these practical issues and the pros and cons of existing PID systems a list of requirements for PID systems is presented which is used to address a number of practical considerations. This section concludes with a number of recommendations.",

    "abstract": "This article will provide a brief overview of considerations made by the UTSC Library in selecting a persistent identifier schema for digital collections in a mid-sized Canadian library.  ARKs were selected for their early support of digital object management, the low-cost/decentralized capabilities of the ARK system, and the usefulness of ARK URLs during system migration projects.  In the absence of a subscription to a centralized resolver service for ARKs, the UTSC Library Digital Scholarship Unit uses a PHP-based application for minting, binding, managing, and tracking ARK IDs. This article will introduce the application’s architecture and affordances, which may be useful to others in the library community with similar use cases, as well as the approach to using ARKs planned for an Islandora 2.x system.",

    "abstract": "As part of the Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA) research project, we have been implementing Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) standards including the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) specifications to disseminate digital objects, their related metadata and streamline our processes. We have taken an incremental approach to IIIF deployment, first by installing the Simple Image Presentation Interface (SIPI), a IIIF Image API 3.0 server, followed by conceiving a workflow based on cookbook recipes created and vetted by the IIIF community for the generation of resources compatible with the IIIF Presentation API 3.0, one of the key components of our architecture. This workflow resulted in a monitoring exercise of this community-driven effort, principally to align the requirements of PIA and the IIIF Presentation API support of software clients.",

    "abstract": "RDF triplestores have become an appealing option for storing and publishing humanities data, but available technologies for querying this data have drawbacks that make them unsuitable for many applications. Gravsearch (Virtual Graph Search), a SPARQL transformer developed as part of a web-based API, is designed to support complex searches that are desirable in humanities research, while avoiding these disadvantages. It does this by introducing server software that mediates between the client and the triplestore, transforming an input SPARQL query into one or more queries executed by the triplestore. This design suggests a practical way to go beyond some limitations of the ways that RDF data has generally been made available.",

Through artificial intelligence (AI)-supported technology, they can now be transcribed and made available for wider audiences. To produce transcriptions an AI needs training and a feasible way is to invite citizens to fulfil such tasks. To understand how an epistemic culture develops in such work, this study conducted interviews with participants on how they associate value, meaning and recognise themselves as active epistemic subjects in relation to the project. Despite that the formation of an epistemic culture are beyond the influence and control of project owners, findings show a strong relation between participants’ knowledge of local history, and personal and emotional ties to archival content, for achieving high quality in AI-transcriptions.",

    "abstract": "Gephi is an open source software for graph and network analysis. It uses a 3D render engine to display large networks in real-time and to speed up the exploration. A flexible and multi-task architecture brings new possibilities to work with complex data sets and produce valuable visual results.  We present several key features of Gephi in the context of interactive exploration and interpretation of networks. It provides easy and broad access to network data and allows for spatializing, filtering, navigating, manipulating and clustering. Finally, by presenting dynamic features of Gephi, we highlight key aspects of dynamic network visualization.",

    "abstract": "Social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ are most visited domains on the Internet. They contain huge data about the users and the relationships among them. To analyze and mine useful information from these huge social network data, special graph based mining tools are required that can easily model the structure of the social networks. A number of such analysis tools are available with their own features and benefits. Choosing an appropriate tool for a particular task is difficult to decide. This work present a comparative analysis of four social network analysis tools-Network, Gephi, Pajek, IGraph based on platform, execution time, Graph types, algorithms complexity, input file format and graph features.",

    "abstract": "Can the university solve the social and political crisis in America?Higher education occupies a difficult place in twenty-first-century American culture. Universities—the institutions that bear so much responsibility for the future health of our nation—are at odds with the very publics they are intended to serve. As Kathleen Fitzpatrick asserts, it is imperative that we re-center the mission of the university to rebuild that lost trust. Critical thinking—the heart of what academics do—can today often negate, refuse, and reject new ideas. In an age characterized by rampant anti-intellectualism, Fitzpatrick charges the academy with thinking constructively rather than competitively, building new ideas rather than tearing old ones down. She urges us to rethink how we teach the humanities and to refocus our attention on the very human ends—the desire for community and connection—that the humanities can best serve. One key aspect of that transformation involves fostering an atmosphere of what Fitzpatrick dubs \"generous thinking,\" a mode of engagement that emphasizes listening over speaking, community over individualism, and collaboration over competition.Fitzpatrick proposes ways that anyone who cares about the future of higher education can work to build better relationships between our colleges and universities and the public, thereby transforming the way our society functions. She encourages interested stakeholders to listen to and engage openly with one another’s concerns by reading and exploring ideas together; by creating collective projects focused around common interests; and by ensuring that our institutions of higher education are structured to support and promote work toward the public good. Meditating on how and why we teach the humanities, Generous Thinking is an audacious book that privileges the ability to empathize and build rather than simply tear apart.",

    "abstract": "NetworkX is a Python language package for exploration and analysis of networks and network algorithms. The core package provides data structures for representing many types of networks, or graphs, including simple graphs, directed graphs, and graphs with parallel edges and self loops. The nodes in NetworkX graphs can be any (hashable) Python object and edges can contain arbitrary data; this flexibility mades NetworkX ideal for representing networks found in many different scientific fields. In addition to the basic data structures many graph algorithms are implemented for calculating network properties and structure measures: shortest paths, betweenness centrality, clustering, and degree distribution and many more. NetworkX can read and write various graph formats for eash exchange with existing data, and provides generators for many classic graphs and popular graph models, such as the Erdoes-Renyi, Small World, and Barabasi-Albert models, are included. The ease-of-use and flexibility of the Python programming language together with connection to the SciPy tools make NetworkX a powerful tool for scientific computations. We discuss some of our recent work studying synchronization of coupled oscillators to demonstrate how NetworkX enables research in the field of computational networks.",

    "abstract": "Traditional martial arts are treasures of humanity’s knowledge and critical carriers of sociocultural memories throughout history. However, such treasured practices have encountered various challenges in knowledge transmission and now feature many entries on the UNESCO list of intangible cultural heritage. In tackling the urgency of knowledge preservation through digital means, this project employs an ontology-based approach to model the conceptual realm of traditional martial arts. Accordingly, it creates the Martial Art Ontology (MAon), a comprehensive domain ontology with an annotated data resource incorporating entities and relations from embodied, epistemic, and sociocultural facets. MAon underlines the significance of embodied qualities and addresses relevant dimensions, such as kinesthetics, techniques, mnemonics, and tactics, along with stylistic, interpretative, and ideological components. It features scholarly terminology developed through literature analysis, interviews with masters, and expert validations. The instantiation of MAon is realized through annotating three archetypal Southern Chinese styles, offering exhaustive descriptions concerning techniques, forms, principles, and form sets, amongst others. In summary, the reported approach encodes the manifold of martial arts into a structured vocabulary and an interlinked data resource, accessible to both human-reading and machine-operating applications. By applying it to manifest a range of knowledge concepts, we demonstrate the potential of ontology-based datafication to create coherent representations for intangible cultural entities and to enable an interoperable data infrastructure across multimodal cultural archives.",

    "abstract": "An argument that the material arrangements of information—how it is represented and interpreted—matter significantly for our experience of information and information systems.Virtual entities that populate our digital experience, like e-books, virtual worlds, and online stores, are backed by the large-scale physical infrastructures of server farms, fiber optic cables, power plants, and microwave links. But another domain of material constraints also shapes digital living: the digital representations sketched on whiteboards, encoded into software, stored in databases, loaded into computer memory, and transmitted on networks. These digital representations encode aspects of our everyday world and make them available for digital processing. The limits and capacities of those representations carry significant consequences for digital society.In The Stuff of Bits, Paul Dourish examines the specific materialities that certain digital objects exhibit. He presents four case studies: emulation, the creation of a “virtual”virtual computer inside another; digital spreadsheets and their role in organizational practice; relational databases and the issue of “the databaseable”the databaseable; and the evolution of digital networking and the representational entailments of network protocols. These case studies demonstrate how a materialist account can offer an entry point to broader concerns—questions of power, policy, and polity in the realm of the digital.",

    "abstract": "A key goal of the fair-ML community is to develop machine-learning based systems that, once introduced into a social context, can achieve social and legal outcomes such as fairness, justice, and due process. Bedrock concepts in computer science—such as abstraction and modular design—are used to define notions of fairness and discrimination, to produce fairness-aware learning algorithms, and to intervene at different stages of a decision-making pipeline to produce \"fair\" outcomes. In this paper, however, we contend that these concepts render technical interventions ineffective, inaccurate, and sometimes dangerously misguided when they enter the societal context that surrounds decision-making systems. We outline this mismatch with five \"traps\" that fair-ML work can fall into even as it attempts to be more context-aware in comparison to traditional data science. We draw on studies of sociotechnical systems in Science and Technology Studies to explain why such traps occur and how to avoid them. Finally, we suggest ways in which technical designers can mitigate the traps through a refocusing of design in terms of process rather than solutions, and by drawing abstraction boundaries to include social actors rather than purely technical ones.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the problem of knowledge in computational informational organisms, i.e. organisms that include a computing machinery at the artifact side. Although information can be understood in many ways, from the second half of the past century information is getting more and more digitised, von Neumann machines becoming dominant. Computational information is a challenge for the act of measuring, as neither purely quantitative nor totally qualitative approaches satisfy the need to explain the interplay among the agents producing and managing computational information. In this paper, Floridi’s method of levels of abstraction is applied to the analysis of computational information, with a chief interest in the concepts of information measure, quantification and quality.",

    "abstract": "Sharing data across scientific domains is often impeded by differences in the language used to describe data and metadata.&nbsp; We argue that disagreements over the boundary between data and metadata are a common source of confusion.&nbsp; Information appearing as data in one domain may be considered metadata in another domain, a process that we call “semantic transposition.”&nbsp; To promote greater understanding, we develop new terminology for describing how data and metadata are structured, and we show how it can be applied to a variety of widely used data formats.&nbsp; Our approach builds upon previous work, such as the Observations and Measurements (ISO 19156) data model. We rely on tools from the Data Documentation Initiative’s Cross Domain Integration (DDI-CDI) to illustrate how the same data can be represented in different ways, and how information considered data in one format can become metadata in another format.",

    "abstract": "To create the basis for the implementation of the Once-Only-Principle in Switzerland, the Swiss Federal Council launched a program called “National Data Management” in 2019. The Once-Only-Principle aims to reduce the administrative burden on citizens and companies. Instead of having to contact them repetitively for the same information, the responsible authorities should strive to exchange the required data. To enable this, we need to actively work on the data landscape of the Swiss administration. The concept of data stewardship is known to be an efficient tool to promote and ensure a consistent high level of data quality. Nowadays public administrations of many countries strive to embrace the idea of data stewardship. This paper describes the approach we have developed for the Swiss administration.",

    "abstract": "This paper was produced as part of the activities of the Humanities and Data Science Special Interest Group based at The Alan Turing Institute. The group has created the opportunity for fruitful conversations in this area and has brought together voices from a range of different disciplinary backgrounds. This document shows an example of how conversations of this type can benefit and advance computational methods and understandings in and between the humanities and data science, bringing together a diverse community. We believe the Turing can act as a nexus of discussion on humanities and data science research at the national (and international) level, in areas such as education strategy, research best practices, and funding policy, and can promote and encourage research activities in this interdisciplinary area.",

    "abstract": "Whatever its name, Free/Libre or Open Source Software (FLOSS), diffusion represents one of the main evolutions of the Information Technology (IT) industry in recent years. Operating System Linux, or Web server Apache (more than 60% market share on its market), database MySQL or PHP languages are some examples of broadly-used FLOSS programs. One of the most original characteristics of this movement is its collective, cooperative software development organization in which a growing number of firms is involved (some figures in Lakhani & Wolf (2005)). Of course, programs, because they are codified information, are quite easy to exchange, and make the cooperation easier than in other industries. But, as pointed out by Stallman (1998), if sharing pieces of software within firms was a dominant practice in the 1950’s, it declined in the 1970’s, and almost disappeared in the 1980’s, before regaining and booming today. This article aims at explaining the evolution (and the comeback) of a cooperative, non-market production. In the first part, we explain the decrease of cooperation as a consequence of the evolution of the computer users, of their demand, and of the industrial organization constructed to meet this demand. This theoretical and historical framework is used in the second part to understand the renewal of a cooperative organization, the FLOSS phenomenon, first among computer-literate users, and then within the industry.",

    "abstract": "It is a challenge to measure the impact of releasing data to the public since the effects may not be directly linked to particular open data activities or substantial impact may only occur several years after publishing the data. This paper proposes a framework to assess the impact of releasing open data by applying the Social Return on Investment (SROI) approach. SROI was developed for organizations intended to generate social and environmental benefits thus fitting the purpose of most open data initiatives. We link the four steps of SROI (input, output, outcome, impact) with the 14 high-value data categories of the G8 Open Data Charter to create a matrix of open data examples, activities, and impacts in each of the data categories. This Impact Monitoring Framework helps data providers to navigate the impact space of open data laying out the conceptual basis for further research.",

Drawing on recent work in literary criticism, the authors study how the social world of the laboratory produces papers and other \"texts,\"’ and how the scientific vision of reality becomes that set of statements considered, for the time being, too expensive to change. The book is based on field work done by Bruno Latour in Roger Guillemin’s laboratory at the Salk Institute and provides an important link between the sociology of modern sciences and laboratory studies in the history of science.",

    "abstract": "This article expands on recent studies of machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that crucially depend on benchmark datasets, often called “ground truths.” These ground-truth datasets gather input-data and output-targets, thereby establishing what can be retrieved computationally and evaluated statistically. I explore the case of the Tumor nEoantigen SeLection Alliance (TESLA), a consortium-based ground-truthing project in personalized cancer immunotherapy, where the “truth” of the targets—immunogenic neoantigens—to be retrieved by the would-be AI algorithms depended on a broad technoscientific network whose setting up implied important organizational and material infrastructures. The study shows that instead of grounding an undisputable “truth”, the TESLA endeavor ended up establishing a contestable reference, the biology of neoantigens and how to measure their immunogenicity having slightly evolved alongside this four-year project. However, even if this controversy played down the scope of the TESLA ground truth, it did not discredit the whole undertaking. The magnitude of the technoscientific efforts that the TESLA project set into motion and the needs it ultimately succeeded in filling for the scientific and industrial community counterbalanced its metrological uncertainties, effectively instituting its contestable representation of “true” neoantigens within the field of personalized cancer immunotherapy (at least temporarily). More generally, this case study indicates that the enforcement of ground truths, and what it leaves out, is a necessary condition to enable AI technologies in personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "This essay attempts to answer three questions about Aristotle’s account of agency: (1) What is an action? (2) Under what conditions is an action voluntary or intentional? (3) What is the relation between an agent and an action when he or she acts voluntarily? This article focuses on those actions that are processes, taking as its starting point Aristotle’s account of processes and capacities in the Physics to suggest that this account underlies his discussion of actions there and elsewhere. In the second part, it is argued that, in the Nicomachean Ethics Aristotle, is concerned with analyzing intentional action in terms of an agent’s capacities (or skills) and their desired goals and knowledge. The final part of the essay contrasts Aristotle’s views of agency with some recent proposals in the philosophy of action.",

    "abstract": "There are three components to boundary objects as outlined in the original 1989 article. Interpretive flexibility, the structure of informatic and work process needs and arrangements, and, finally, the dynamic between ill-structured and more tailored uses of the objects. Much of the use of the concept has concentrated on the aspect of interpretive flexibility and has often mistaken or conflated this flexibility with the process of tacking back-and-forth between the ill-structured and well-structured aspects of the arrangements. Boundary objects are not useful at just any level of scale or without full consideration of the entire model. The article discusses these aspects of the architecture of boundary objects and includes a discussion of one of the ways that boundary objects appeared as a concept in earlier work done by Star. It concludes with methodological considerations about how to study the system of boundary objects and infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "This theoretical paper considers the morality of machine learning algorithms and systems in the light of the biases that ground their correctness. It begins by presenting biases not as a priori negative entities but as contingent external referents—often gathered in benchmarked repositories called ground-truth datasets—that define what needs to be learned and allow for performance measures. I then argue that ground-truth datasets and their concomitant practices—that fundamentally involve establishing biases to enable learning procedures—can be described by their respective morality, here defined as the more or less accounted experience of hesitation when faced with what pragmatist philosopher William James called “genuine options”—that is, choices to be made in the heat of the moment that engage different possible futures. I then stress three constitutive dimensions of this pragmatist morality, as far as ground-truthing practices are concerned: (I) the definition of the problem to be solved (problematization), (II) the identification of the data to be collected and set up (databasing), and (III) the qualification of the targets to be learned (labeling). I finally suggest that this three-dimensional conceptual space can be used to map machine learning algorithmic projects in terms of the morality of their respective and constitutive ground-truthing practices. Such techno-moral graphs may, in turn, serve as equipment for greater governance of machine learning algorithms and systems.",

Central to DH research is the practice of modelling, which involves translating intricate knowledge systems into computational models. This book addresses a fundamental query: How can an effective language be developed to conceptualize and guide modelling in DH? Modelling, with its historical roots, carries multifaceted meanings influenced by various disciplinary contexts. Modelling Between Digital and Humanities innovatively connects DH with the historical tradition of model-based thinking in the humanities, cultural studies, and the sciences. It endeavors to reshape interpretative frameworks by contextualizing DH’s modelling practices within a broader conceptual landscape. Through an exploration of digital, visual and data models, the book asserts that DH holds the potential to be a cornerstone of a novel cultural literacy paradigm. By probing the interplay between technology and thought, the book ultimately positions DH as a catalyst for transformative cultural insights. , This volume presents an exploration of Digital Humanities (DH), a field focused on the reciprocal transformation of digital technologies and humanities scholarship.

    "abstract": "A laboratory study that investigates how algorithms come into existence. Algorithms—often associated with the terms big data, machine learning, or artificial intelligence—underlie the technologies we use every day, and disputes over the consequences, actual or potential, of new algorithms arise regularly. In this book, Florian Jaton offers a new way to study computerized methods, providing an account of where algorithms come from and how they are constituted, investigating the practical activities by which algorithms are progressively assembled rather than what they may suggest or require once they are assembled. Drawing on a four-year ethnographic study of a computer science laboratory that specialized in digital image processing, Jaton illuminates the invisible processes that are behind the development of algorithms. Tracing what he terms a set of intertwining courses of actions sharing common finalities, he describes the practical activity of creating algorithms through the lenses of ground-truthing, programming, and formulating. He first presents the building of ground truths, referential repositories that form the material basis for algorithms. Then, after considering programming’s resistance to ethnographic scrutiny, he describes programming courses of action he attended at the laboratory. Finally, he offers an account of courses of action that successfully formulated some of the relationships among the data of a ground-truth database, revealing the links between ground-truthing, programming, and formulating activities—entangled processes that lead to the shaping of algorithms. In practice, ground-truthing, programming, and formulating form a whirlwind process, an emergent and intertwined agency. The open access edition of this book was made possible by generous funding from Arcadia – a charitable fund of Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin.",

    "abstract": "This article documents the practical efforts of a group of scientists designing an image-processing algorithm for saliency detection. By following the actors of this computer science project, the article shows that the problems often considered to be the starting points of computational models are in fact provisional results of time-consuming, collective and highly material processes that engage habits, desires, skills and values. In the project being studied, problematization processes lead to the constitution of referential databases called “ground truths” that enable both the effective shaping of algorithms and the evaluation of their performances. Working as important common touchstones for research communities in image processing, the ground truths are inherited from prior problematization processes and may be imparted to subsequent ones. The ethnographic results of this study suggest two complementary analytical perspectives on algorithms: (1) an “axiomatic” perspective that understands algorithms as sets of instructions designed to solve given problems computationally in the best possible way, and (2) a “problem-oriented” perspective that understands algorithms as sets of instructions designed to computationally retrieve outputs designed and designated during specific problematization processes. If the axiomatic perspective on algorithms puts the emphasis on the numerical transformations of inputs into outputs, the problem-oriented perspective puts the emphasis on the definition of both inputs and outputs.",

    "abstract": "The new ARPANET routing algorithm is an improvement over the old procedure in that it uses fewer network resources, operates on more realistic estimates of network conditions, reacts faster to important network changes, and does not suffer from long-term loops or oscillations. In the new procedure, each node in the network maintains a database describing the complete network topology and the delays on all lines, and uses the database describing the network to generate a tree representing the minimum delay paths from a given root node to every other network node. Because the traffic in the network can be quite variable, each node periodically measures the delays along its outgoing lines and forwards this information to all other nodes. The delay information propagates quickly through the network so that all nodes can update their databases and continue to route traffic in a consistent and efficient manner. An extensive series of tests were conducted on the ARPANET, showing that line overhead and CPU overhead are both less than two percent, most nodes learn of an update within 100 ms, and the algorithm detects congestion and routes packets around congested areas.",

However, due to the size and high-resolution nature of these images, they are generally only accessed in smaller sections or “tiles” via specialized platforms, most of which require extensive setup and/or costly infrastructure. These platforms typically also need a copy of the images to be locally available to them, potentially causing issues with data governance and provenance.",

This inflection point marks a shift from explicit knowledge representation to a renewed focus on the hybrid representation of both explicit knowledge and parametric knowledge. In this position paper, we will discuss some of the common debate points within the community on LLMs (parametric knowledge) and Knowledge Graphs (explicit knowledge) and speculate on opportunities and visions that the renewed focus brings, as well as related research topics and challenges.",

    "abstract": "Information systems are developed by people with intent—they are designed to help creators and users tell specific stories with data. Within information systems, the often invisible structures of metadata profoundly impact the meaning that can be derived from that data. The Linked Infrastructure for Networked Cultural Scholarship project (LINCS) helps humanities researchers tell stories by using linked open data to convert humanities datasets into organized, interconnected, machine-processable resources. LINCS provides context for online cultural materials, interlinks them, and grounds them in sources to improve web resources for research. This article describes how the LINCS team is using the shared standards of linked data and especially ontologies—typically unseen yet powerful—to bring meaning mindfully to metadata through structure. The LINCS metadata—comprised of linked open data about cultural artifacts, people, and processes—and the structures that support it must represent multiple, diverse ways of knowing. It needs to enable various means of incorporating contextual data and of telling stories with nuance and context, situated and supported by data structures that reflect and make space for specificities and complexities. As it addresses specificity in each research dataset, LINCS is simultaneously working to balance interoperability, as achieved through a level of generalization, with contextual and domain-specific requirements. The LINCS team’s approach to ontology adoption and use centers on intersectionality, multiplicity, and difference. The question of what meaning the structures being used will bring to the data is as important as what meaning is introduced as a result of linking data together, and the project has built this premise into its decision-making and implementation processes. To convey an understanding of categories and classification as contextually embedded—culturally produced, intersecting, and discursive—the LINCS team frames them not as fixed but as grounds for investigation and starting points for understanding. Metadata structures are as important as vocabularies for producing such meaning.",

    "abstract": "Data science is not a science. It is a research paradigm. Its power, scope, and scale will surpass science, our most powerful research paradigm, to enable knowledge discovery and change our world. We have yet to understand and define it, vital to realizing its potential and managing its risks. Modern data science is in its infancy. Emerging slowly since 1962 and rapidly since 2000, it is a fundamentally new field of inquiry, one of the most active, powerful, and rapidly evolving 21st century innovations. Due to its value, power, and applicability, it is emerging in over 40 disciplines, hundreds of research areas, and thousands of applications. Millions of data science publications contain myriad definitions of data science and data science problem solving. Due to its infancy, many definitions are independent, application specific, mutually incomplete, redundant, or inconsistent, hence so is data science. This research addresses this data science multiple definitions challenge by proposing the development of coherent, unified definition based on a data science reference framework using a data science journal for the data science community to achieve such a definition. This paper provides candidate definitions for essential data science artifacts that are required to discuss such a definition. They are based on the classical research paradigm concept consisting of a philosophy of data science, the data science problem solving paradigm, and the six component data science reference framework (axiology, ontology, epistemology, methodology, methods, technology) that is a frequently called for unifying framework with which to define, unify, and evolve data science. It presents challenges for defining data science, solution approaches, i.e., means for defining data science, and their requirements and benefits as the basis of a comprehensive solution.",

    "abstract": "Modern-day research in digital humanities is an inherently intersectional activity that borrows from, and in turn contributes to, a multitude of domains previously seen as having little bearing on the discipline at hand. Art history, for instance, operates today at the crossroads of social studies, digital libraries, geographical information systems, data modelling, and cognitive computing, yet its problems inform research questions within all of these fields, which veer towards making the output of prior research readily available to humanists in their interaction with digital resources. This is reflected in the way data are represented, stored and published: with various intra- and inter-institutional research endeavours relying upon output that could and should be shared, the notion of “leaving the data silo” with a view on interoperability acquires even greater significance. Scholars and policymakers are supporting this view with guidelines, such as the FAIR principles, and standards, such as Linked Open Data, that implement them, with technologies whose coverage, complexity and lifespans vary. A point is being approached, however, where the technological opportunities permit a continuous interoperability between established and concluded data-intensive projects, and current projects whose underlying datasets evolve. This enables the data production of one institution to be viewed as one harmonically interlinked knowledge graph, which can be queried through a global understanding of the ontological models that dominate the fields involved. This paper is an overview of past and present efforts of mine in the creation of digital humanities knowledge graphs over the past decade, from music history to the societal ramifications of the history of architecture. This contribution highlights the variability of concurrent research environments at the Bibliotheca Hertziana, not only in the state of their activities, but also in the ways they manage their data life-cycles, and exemplifies possible combinations of FAIR data management platforms and integration techniques, suitable for different scenarios resulting from such variability. The paper concludes with an example of how feedback from the art history domain called for novel directions for data science and Semantic Web scholars to follow, by proposing that the Linked Open Data paradigm adopt a notion of usability in the very morphology of published data, thus becoming Linked Open Usable Data.",

    "abstract": "Addressing a larger context of trends shaping and influencing change in the humanities and the cultures of the university, this text follows the Antonio Zampolli Prize Lecture given on 2 July 2014 at U Lausanne, exploring and encouraging the digital humanities’ positive role in the process of the humanities’ digital self-determination in the digital realm. Considered in this engagement are: the important (and profitably-elusive) process of defining digital humanities; foundational notions of the methodological commons and communities of practice, and the ways in which they originate, are fostered, are engaged, and themselves engage; and the value of an open approach to current and future work on modeling humanistic data and process, in ways that build on these foundations to embrace the communities and constituencies served by the humanities.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines current Cultural Heritage-based Linked data and linked open data projects developed by Libraries, Archives and Museums (LAMs). The following research questions are explored: R1: Are there similarities and/or differences between libraries, archives and museums in how their linked data and linked open data projects, approaches and strategies are being implemented? R2: What specific linked data and linked open data tools and tactics are being employed, and are there key variations between libraries, archives and museums? The linked data/linked open data landscape has advanced since Tim Berners-Lee (et al.) introduced the concept of the Semantic Web, but challenges for LAMs remain as they work with their collections’ data to create new web-based projects. Fundamental to these efforts is the creation, linking, and publishing of good quality metadata that will allow LAM collections to be discovered, accessed, and disseminated through viable methods. Trends across LAM sectors for linked data and linked open data projects include: global communication and collaborative research, use of wiki-based technologies, and efforts to improve sustainability. Application concepts from the Digital Curation Centre’s Curation Lifecycle Model and Adrian Brown’s Digital Preservation Maturity Model may help guide LAMs toward greater sustainability of linked data and linked open data collections’ projects.

Starting from the invention of the World Wide Web in 1989 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee this Web is on an evolution to the so called Web 4.0. Before we will reach that we have to ll the Semantic Web as part of the Web 3.0 with resources and research content. Therefore the 5 star open data principles, the Linked Open Data principles, the 5 star LOUD principles and the FAIR principles are necessary. I will merge all of that principles in the so called Sphere 7 Data principles, described in this paper.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce Linked Open Data (LOD) in the archaeological domain as a means to connect dispersed data sources and enable cross-querying. The technology behind the design principles and how LOD can be created and published is described to enable less-familiar researchers to understand the presented benefits and drawbacks of LOD. Wikidata is introduced as an open knowledge hub for the creation and dissemination of LOD. Different actors within archaeology have implemented LOD, and we present which challenges have been and are being addressed. A selection of projects showcases how Wikidata is being used by archaeologists to enrich and open their databases to the general public. With this paper, we aim to encourage the creation and re-use of LOD in archaeology, as we believe it offers an improvement on current data publishing practices.",

    "abstract": "The demand for integrating and sharing heterogeneous data online has attracted the interest of cultural institutions in making information access and retrieval more effective via Semantic Web technologies. The present study proposes a digital repository for 3D scans of modernist sculptures in public spaces in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with a view to ensuring access, use, reuse and preservation of this information. This is a qualitative exploratory experimental study based on the scientific literature and specific empirical material. It presents the analysis results of vocabularies for physical artifact documents and their digital counterparts on the Semantic Web and a discussion on how these align with the nature of the metadata determined here, as well as a metadata modeling prototype implemented on the Tainacan platform and aimed at cataloging digital 3D replicas. We claim that the proposed model for documenting cultural heritage assets on Tainacan is easy to implement, in that it uses accessible technology with a wide internet user base, highly expressive in its descriptions of 3D and multimedia content and based on well-established metadata and ontology standards recommended by regulatory bodies and communities such as the World Wide Web Consortium and International Organization for Standardization.

    "abstract": "Das Fotoalbum als Aufbewahrungsort einzelner Abzüge zählt seit den Anfängen zur Geschichte der Fotografie. Anfangs mit vorgestanzten Ausschnitten und gedruckter OrNamentik hochwertig gestaltet, entwickelte es sich mit dem Siegeszug der Privatfotografie im ersten Drittel des 20. Jahrhunderts als Massenartikel zum festen Bestandteil eines jeden Haushalts. Fotoalben bieten kuratierte Einblicke in den privaten Alltag. Sie geben Aufschluss darüber, was als festhaltenswert und erinnerungswürdig galt. Ausschnitthaft lassen sie die Betrachterin und den Betrachter an Unternehmungen teilhaben - an Reisen, Familienfeiern, Ausflügen, Kindheiten, aber erinnern auch an die Schrecken des Krieges. Oftmals ergänzen handschriftliche Kommentare und applizierte Tickets, Briefe oder Postkarten die eingeklebten Fotografien. Einige Forschungsprojekte, etwa am Volkskundemuseum Wien sowie am Deutschen Historischen Museum Berlin, haben in jüngerer Zeit Interesse an Fotoalben gezeigt. Daran knüpfte die Tagung \"Kuratierte Erinnerungen: das Fotoalbum\" im November 2022 an. Organisiert wurde sie von der Kommission Fotografie der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Empirische Kulturwissenschaft in Kooperation mit den Staatlichen Museen zu Berlin im dortigen Museum für Fotografie. Der Tagungsband vereint Beiträge von Wissenschaftler_innen aus Geschichte, Empirischer Kulturwissenschaft, Europäischer Ethnologie, Medienwissenschaft, Kunstgeschichte, Literaturwissenschaft, Erziehungswissenschaft und Pädagogik. Er liefert eine facettenreiche Sicht auf das Fotoalbum als bis in die Gegenwart überaus populäres Medium",

    "abstract": "As part of the Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA) research project, the Knowledge Representation of cultural heritage resources, and mainly three photographic collections from the Swiss Society for Folklore Studies (SSFS), will be done using Linked Art, an RDF profile of the CIDOC-CRM ontology serialised in JSON-LD. This modelling will be carried out on the basis of the future SSFS Data Model as well as new assertions generated by the addition of end-user resources, the metadata enrichment via crowdsourcing as well as annotations created by Machine Learning methods notably through vitrivr, a multimedia retrieval system. For the design of the PIA Data Model, and more generally for any Knowledge Representation, questions arise as to what influences the various groups of individuals involved in the process have, firstly on each other, secondly on the manifestation of the model and subsequently on how this particular Knowledge Representation will impact the different stakeholders, once it is implemented but equally throughout its creation. A preliminary framework for analysing the process of creating the PIA Data Model is to look it through the actor-network theory (ANT) lens, a constructivist approach defined mainly by Bruno Latour. Looking at data modelling through the ANT lens will be documented on https://phd.julsraemy.ch/ Recording of the presentation: https://youtu.be/YBMbSbroTAU",

    "abstract": "Computing and the use of digital sources and resources is an everyday and essential practice in current academic scholarship. The present article gives a concise overview of approaches and methods within digital historical scholarship, focusing on the question “How have the digital humanities evolved and what has that evolution brought to historical scholarship?” We begin by discussing techniques in which data are generated and machine searchable, such as OCR/HTR, born-digital archives, computer vision, scholarly editions and linked data. In the second section, we provide examples of how data is made more accessible through quantitative text and network analysis. The third section considers the need for hermeneutics and data-awareness in digital historical scholarship. The technologies described in this article have had varying degrees of effect on historical scholarship, usually in indirect ways. With this article we aim to take stock of the digital approaches and methods used in historical scholarship in order to provide starting points for scholars seeking to understand the digital turn in the field and how and when to implement such approaches in their work.",

    "abstract": "The idea behind the DARIAH Research Data Management Working Group is to tackle the challenges associated with the implementation of new FAIR and open data sharing mandates, and offer a unique space for collaboration among representatives of all major arts and humanities disciplines, cultural heritage professionals, and data management experts. More specifically, we are building a knowledge hub for new professionals around data management support (data managers, data stewards, open science officers, subject librarians etc.) from across DARIAH’s national hubs to exchange across the discipline-specific dimension. During our meetings, the conflict between the need for and emergence of new data support roles, and the lack of any established domain-specific curriculum to train them, or, in some cases, even a lack of established good practices, became a recurrent topic which we aimed to address. Instead of embarking on the giant endeavour of curating an exhaustive and authoritative textbook for research data support specialists who work in the arts and humanities field, our idea is to give a snapshot of our own activities in the field and highlight the valuable work of others. Accordingly, the present publication can be read as the written form of a roundtable (or town hall) discussion where experts from Austria, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain have come and sat together to report and discuss past or ongoing work, share their fields of interests and provide honest and critical reflections, reveal how their institutions have developed capacities for data support, share their own stories of becoming data support professionals in the domain, and, most importantly, explore together what solutions, tools, practices, and other resources could be used and could be generalised across borders and disciplines. This publication is the result of the Working Group’s first writing sprint, held between the 23 and 24 June 2022 at the Institute of Literary Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IBL PAN), in the Staszic Palace. The event was made possible by the DARIAH third Working Groups’ (WG) Funding Scheme Call for the years 2021–2023 and the resulting grant, which was administered by the Digital Humanities Centre at the Institute of Literary Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IBL PAN).",

    "abstract": "Where does linked data fit in archival description? How do we get from promise to implementation? This article evaluates the benefits and limitations of current approaches to linked data in archival work. It proposes four pragmatic principles for the archival community to follow when determining how to pursue linked data. This approach engages with communities (both inside and outside cultural heritage institutions) already publishing linked data, accounts for institutional resource limitations, and recognizes the need for technological, educational, and social support for institutions and workers. Through an examination of the work of the Archives and Linked Data Interest Group with Schema.org and Wikidata, the article provides case studies that explore how these pragmatic principles for archival linked data create inclusive, rather than exclusive, communities.",

    "abstract": "The term community of practice (CoP) has been applied to segments of work in the digital humanities in numerous ways over the years: as library training initiatives (Green 2014), as work around a specific encoding practice (Flanders and Jannidis 2015), and even to the DH community as a whole (Siemens 2016). This term, coined in 1991, was originally applied to learning, which the authors claimed was a “sociocultural practice” (Lave and Wenger). It has been further developed by Wenger (2011), who defines it as follows: “Communities of practice are groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly.” In this panel, we use this latter definition as a framework for reflecting on the first year of work in the Linked Infrastructure for Networked Cultural Scholarship (LINCS) Project.",

    "abstract": "Libraries, archives, and museums (LAMs) have, for many years, devoted considerable resources toward the cataloging and digitization of their collections. In addition to providing access via online collections searches, many have established digital infrastructure that enable them to share their datasets and images with other memory institutions and aggregators, participating in the evolution of both metadata practices and technology. The wider context of the network, however, requires that LAM resources be interoperable across institutions, and it is clear that locally developed solutions for the delivery of data and images can be problematic to maintain over time and difficult to scale-up. This chapter will examine how standards and descriptive practices are impacted by digital collaboration, while acknowledging that collaboration-based data and technology solutions may be effective in producing sustainable platforms, with some strategic investment centered around staff competency. An examination of recent initiatives, such as the Linked Open Data profile Linked Art and the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF), will be highlighted as models of collaboration that promise a different economic sustainability matrix. Finally this chapter discusses the strong correlation between an institutionalized and standard compliant digital practice and the public’s engagement with the institution.",

    "abstract": "This writing utilizes the case study of a specific project, namely adopting a Digital Asset Management System (DAMS) based on open source technologies at the Art Institute of Chicago (AIC), to describe the thought process, which along the way led to the discovery of Linked Data and more general technology development practices based on community participation. In order to better replicate such a thought process and its evolution into a broader strategy that goes beyond technology, this paper will begin by describing the problem that the Collection IT team at AIC had been initially tasked to resolve, and its technical implementation. After that, the paper will treat the strategic shift of resources from a self-contained production and review cycle toward an exchange-based economy. The challenges, both external and internal, posed by this change will be addressed. All the while, the paper will highlight perspectives and challenges related to the museum sector, and the efforts of AIC to adopt views and methodologies that have traditionally been associated with the library world. A section is dedicated to ongoing efforts of the same nature among museums.",

    "abstract": "The joint project ClaReNet, funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, is testing the possibilities and the limits of new methods of classification and representation on the basis of three Celtic coinages, each selected as an example for specific research questions and problems. Traditional approaches to classification in numismatics and archaeology are compared with classification methods from information technology, including deep learning. An extendable virtual union catalogue, celticcoinage.org, complying with the FAIR principles, will be implemented for the coin series that we are investigating. The work process will be accompanied by a science and technology study, which will contribute to a reflection on the changes in knowledge processes that result from the use of digital tools and algorithms. The aim is to systematically assess in an interdisciplinary dialogue the potential and limits of automation for processes of classification and representation in numismatics and archaeology.",

    "abstract": "The burgeoning field of Digital Humanities has seen a great deal of interest in methodologies that support the exploration, cross-pollination, and programmatic analysis of heritage collections across the web of data. Although the heritage community has generally agreed that these data should be semantically enriched using the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model and published as Linked Open Data, a lack of agreement at both data and infrastructural levels has hindered advancements that would allow for greater data integration and computational exploration. This project provides an institutional roadmap for publishing such data in a Semantic Web research environment, proposing a set of best practices for the community. Using a collection of 230,000 images and index metadata, this project presents methodologies and tools for data cleaning, reconciliation, enrichment, and transformation for publishing in a native Resource Description Framework system. A semantic framework for integrating computer vision services enables subsequent enrichment and visual analysis, enabling the mass-digitization of heritage collections with minimal burden on institutions, all while ensuring the long-term preservation and interoperability of these data at a global scale.",

Digital art history or historical research facilitated by computer-technology in general is omnipresent in academia and increasingly supported by an infrastructure of seminars, workshops, networks, journals and other platforms for sharing results, exchanging notes and developing criticism. As the wealth of historical and contemporary data is rapidly expanding and digital technologies are becoming integral to research in the humanities and social sciences, it is high time to reflect on the different strategies that art market scholars employ to navigate and negotiate digital techniques and resources.",

    "abstract": "<strong>Back and Forth from Boundary Objects to IIIF Resources: The Recipes of a Community-driven Initiative Specifying Standards</strong> Scientific poster presented at the DARIAH-CH Study Day in Mendrisio, Switzerland, on 20 October 2022 <strong>Abstract</strong> The exchange of digital objects and their associated metadata is simplified when these meet established standards, but the capture of all the (meta)information is still very much in tension, at the limits of resources, knowledge and indeed the underlying capabilities of given standards. These limitations can be translated into what Susan Leigh Star defines as residual categories and consequently the generation of boundary objects. The question of these non-standardised residuals within the cultural heritage and digital humanities fields is an iterative identification issue that institutions and individuals have sought to mitigate. Take for instance resources conforming to the application programming interfaces (APIs) of the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF). These are JSON-LD serialised objects duly specified and vetted by a community trying to break institutional silos. Of particular interest are resources compliant with the IIIF Presentation API which underpins what a <strong>Manifest</strong> is, i.e.: a description of the structure and properties of the compound object which can be interpreted by a client and displayed to end-users, typically disseminated openly on the Web. While on the surface or theoretically these IIIF Manifests, or <em>compound objects</em>, could be quite the antithesis of boundary objects, it remains to be seen to what extent IIIF-compatible resources revolve around residual categories and also from what point onward these Manifests have been at some point or revert to boundary objects, whether they are not well-structured or simply because the architecture and constituent software serving and interpreting them (known as viewers in the IIIF ecosystem) do not operate correctly. <strong>Additional resources:</strong> Presentation made on Exhibit: https://www.exhibit.so/exhibits/cXc5lm2e0G10tDVywh9b Verbose script as a blog post: https://julsraemy.ch/posts/2022/10/05/boundary-objects-iiif-dariah/ IIIF Manifest (JSON-LD): https://julsraemy.ch/hostiiing/manifests/backandforth.json Dataset which describes all of this in Schema.org (JSON-LD): https://julsraemy.ch/assets/metadata/backandforth.json",

    "abstract": "We reflect on some of the preliminary findings of the Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA) research project around annotations of photographic archives from the Swiss Society for Folklore Studies (SSFS) as knowledge practices, the underlying technological decisions, and their impact. The aim is not only to seek more information but to find new approaches of understanding the way in which people’s memory relate to the collective, public form of archival memory and ultimately how users figure in and shape the digital archive. We provide a proof-of-concept workflow based on automatically generated annotations comprising 53,481 photos that were subjected to object detection using Faster R-CNN Inception ResNet V2. Of the detected objects, 184,609 have a detection score greater than 0.5, 123,529 have a score greater than 0.75, and 88,442 have a score greater than 0.9. A threshold of 0.75 was set for the dissemination of our annotations, compatible with the W3C Web Annotation Data Model (WADM) and embedded in our IIIF Manifests. In the near future, the workflow will be upgraded to allow for the co-existence of various, and occasionally conflicting, assertions made by both human and machine users. We believe that Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) standards should be used to improve the sustainability of such an ecosystem and to foster collaboration between actors in cultural heritage.",

    "abstract": "In the context of my PhD in Digital Humanities at the University of Basel (2021-2025), I investigate the semantics and interoperability dimensions of standards that adhere to the Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) design principles, such as the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) specifications and more specifically the IIIF Presentation API 3.0, Linked Art and the Web Annotation Data Model. This presentation is an opportunity to delve into one of my research questions which is related to the practices of IIIF and Linked Art by drawing attention to the social fabrics that constitute these communities notably from the standpoint of the Actor-Network Theory (ANT), a constructivist approach widely spread in Science and Technology Studies (STS) which should help me to better comprehend the roles and relationships of all actors in the implementation of LOUD standards within the cultural heritage domain and more broadly across the Digital Humanities. While the presentation, structured around two parts, is aimed at a general audience and accessible to all, more technical aspects are also discussed, for example to illustrate how IIIF APIs are developed and maintained. Firstly, I intend to identify the sociotechnical requirements for the establishment of community-driven initiatives, looking in particular at associations that are constituted around consensus-building and advocacy efforts. There are many good cases here, from the creation of community and technical specification groups, the relationship between the consortium and the community, the extent to which transparency plays a vital role, but also the relevance and impact of nonhuman actors such as data models, APIs, validators, as well as collaboratively developed software. This first part will also provide a means of testing the hypothesis that community-driven specifications, if they require significant commitment from all sides and are developed slowly, tend to be successful in the medium to long term. Secondly, I will explore how the implementation of IIIF has progressed within cultural heritage institutions and the potential of the framework in relation to scientific movements and principles, such as Open Science, Citizen Science, FAIR as well as CARE. I will give an overview of the various surveys conducted within the IIIF community in recent years and present the results of my own investigation determining where IIIF stands both conceptually and technically. This second part offers a chance to report on the four key initiatives (Advocacy & Leadership, Technical Development, Community Development, Membership & Value) of the strategic framework presented at the IIIF online event held in December 2022. More generally, this will be a platform to revisit and discuss over ten years of IIIF practice, the intersection with Linked Art for semantically conveying knowledge in an event-based manner and for metadata aggregation, and the Web Annotation Data Model for driving multi-layered assertions from observations to rich narratives, and to consider how LOUD situates itself in relation to communities maintaining such specifications.

    "abstract": "Abstract A collaboration between the Linked Art II project and Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA) has led to a reconfigurable Python-based workflow to transform cultural heritage data, initially photographic collections, into Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD), as a foundation for varied participatory interfaces supporting scholarship and beyond. Motivation PIA, led by the University of Basel and the Bern Academy of the Arts, aims to encourage participation from scholars and the wider public through three collections from the photographic archives of the Swiss Society for Folklore Studies (SSFS): The Atlas of Swiss Folklore, Ernst Brunner, and Kreis Family. PIA aims to create multiple interfaces reflecting diverse perspectives by deploying community-developed LOUD specifications such as the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) and Linked Art, an RDF application profile (JSON-LD) based on CIDOC-CRM to describe object-based cultural heritage. In collaboration with the University of Oxford via the Linked Art II project, PIA has transformed their cultural heritage collection data into Linked Art using templates, which encapsulate the data characteristics and cataloguing practices.  A Linked Art API will provide an additional entry point, as a means of conveying semantically enriched events and as a benchmark against other collections leveraging this model. Python-based Workflow To generate Linked Art files for the combined PIA collection a data transformation workflow has been created through which PIA templates were encoded in Python for a given Linked Art API entity endpoint, currently: DigitalObject HumanMadeObject and Set. The workflow, described in a use case example with a photograph from the Ernst Brunner collection, provides a three-step software process for transforming data into Linked Art. Query: The first Python script extracts collection data from the (legacy) PIA JSON API. YAML front matters are used for script variables. The filepath for the relevant .yaml file is specified as a script argument throughout the workflow. For our example, the script queried data for all images looking for DigitalObject entities (one of the variables) and the object’s metadata that are stored come specifically from https://json.participatory-archives.ch/api/v1/images/12033} Map: Templates are used to map collection data to an intermediate JSON data format. The intermediate JSON data format means that the later transformation script that creates Linked Art JSON-LD does not necessarily need to be modified if a new data source is introduced. Transform: The intermediate JSON data format is transformed to Linked Art with Python functions that define “patterns” (for example classified_as) for representing different aspects of photographic collection data as Linked Art. Future Work The SSFS will migrate its database into the DaSCH Service Platform (DSP) and amend their data model which will affect PIA, requiring an upgrade of its infrastructure and APIs. The workflow for creating Linked Art representations will have to be reconfigured and repurposed with different data sources. After the migration of the SSFS database, the PIA team will investigate remaining issues in the GitHub repository regarding the correct mapping of Linked Art entities and attribution of IDs. The team will work to ensure that the appropriate Linked Art modelling is achieved through the workflow. Conclusion The reconfigurable Python-based workflow is able to transform cultural heritage data, initially photographic collections, into LOUD, as a foundation for varied participatory interfaces supporting scholarship and beyond. The adaptability and extensibility of the workflow allows for potential future transformations of data from other collections to Linked Art.

    "abstract": "Linked Data technologies are used to describe and connect entities, based on features they have in common. Rich semantic descriptions, disambiguation capabilities, and interoperability allow investigation of new research questions and reveal previously undiscovered relationships. However, previous studies have shown that uptake of Linked Data among Humanities researchers has, thus far, been low, partly due to usability issues with the resulting tools and resources. I therefore set out to investigate how their usability might be improved, and how Linked Data technologies might most effectively be integrated with existing research methods. My study focused on the Ancient World, where Linked Data implementation seems to be higher than in other Humanities disciplines, and involved a survey and interviews to elicit user and producer needs from researchers in this subject area. <br></br><br></br> I start this thesis by introducing and contextualising my research topic in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2, I consult existing literature and datasets to discuss Linked Humanities Data implementation, its advantages, and current barriers. Chapter 3 provides an outline of my survey and interview methodologies, while Chapter 4 presents initial survey analysis and identifies themes for discussion in the subsequent chapters. Chapter 5 focuses on five research methods already embedded in the practices of Ancient World researchers, where Linked Data could effectively be integrated: <i>Discovering, Gathering, Data Recognition, Annotating,</i> and <i>Visualization</i>. In Chapter 6, I explore the user experience more broadly, including aspects such as interface design, reliability, and data quality. Chapter 7 then discusses areas of the production process that affect Linked Data usability: training, collaboration, user-centred design, documentation, access, and sustainability. My findings form the basis of a series of recommendations in Chapter 8, which focus on teamwork, openness and transparency, extensibility, user consultation, discoverability, sustainability, and communities, culminating in a <i>Five-Star Model for Linked Humanities Data Usability.</i>",

Moreover, open source software, open geodata and open access are becoming increasingly important. As part of the Semantic Web, Linked Open Data (LOD) must be created and published in order to provide free open geodata in interoperable formats. With this semantically structured and standardised data it is easy to implement tools for GIS applications e.g. QGIS. In these days, the world’s Cultural Heritage (CH) is being destroyed as a result of wars, sea-level rise, floods and other natural disasters by climate change. Several transnational initiatives try to preserve our CH via digitisation initiatives. As best practice for preserving CH data serves the Ogi Ogam Project with the aim to show an easy volunteered approach to modelling Irish ‘Ogam Stones‘ containing Ogham inscriptions in Wikidata and interlinking them with spatial information in OpenStreetMap and (geo)resources on the web. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG  Geodäten arbeiten in der Industrie 4.0 mit vernetzten Maschinen, Menschen und Daten. Zudem werden die Themen Open Source Software, offene Geodaten und Open Access immer wichtiger. Linked Open Data (LOD) müssen erstellt und veröffentlicht werden, um so freie und offene Geodaten in interoperablen Formaten als Teil des Semantic Web zur Verfügung zu stellen. Mit diesen semantisch strukturierten und standardisierten Daten ist es einfach Tools für GIS Applikationen, z.B. QGIS, zu erstellen. Zurzeit werden Kulturgüter (CH) der Welt durch Kriege, Meeresspiegelanstieg, Überflutungen und andere Naturkatastrophen, die durch den Klimawandel verursacht wurden, zerstört. Einige transnationale Initiativen versuchen daher die Kulturgüter durch Digitalisierungs-Initiativen zu erhalten. Als Beispiel dient hier die Digitalisierung im Ogi Ogham Projekt, das zum Ziel hat, einen einfachen auf Freiwilligenbasis fußenden Ansatz zu verfolgen, der irische ‘Ogham Steine‘ und deren Ogham Inschriften in Wikidata modelliert und diese mit Geodaten aus OpenStreetMap und deren Geodaten im Web referenziert.",

    "abstract": "The BiCIKL project is born from a vision that biodiversity data are most useful if they are presented as a network of data that can be integrated and viewed from different starting points. BiCIKL’s goal is to realise that vision by linking biodiversity data infrastructures, particularly for literature, molecular sequences, specimens, nomenclature and analytics. To make those links we need to better understand the existing infrastructures, their limitations, the nature of the data they hold, the services they provide and particularly how they can interoperate. In light of those aims, in the autumn of 2021, 74 people from the biodiversity data community engaged in a total of twelve hackathon topics with the aim to assess the current state of interoperability between infrastructures holding biodiversity data. These topics examined interoperability from several angles. Some were research subjects that required interoperability to get results, some examined modalities of access and the use and implementation of standards, while others tested technologies and workflows to improve linkage of different data types.These topics and the issues in regard to interoperability uncovered by the hackathon participants inspired the formulation of the following recommendations for infrastructures related to (1) the use of data brokers, (2) building communities and trust, (3) cloud computing as a collaborative tool, (4) standards and (5) multiple modalities of access:If direct linking cannot be supported between infrastructures, explore using data brokers to store linksCooperate with open linkage brokers to provide a simple way to allow two-way links between infrastructures, without having to co-organize between many different organisationsFacilitate and encourage the external reporting of issues related to their infrastructure and its interoperability.Facilitate and encourage requests for new features related to their infrastructure and its interoperability.Provide development roadmaps openlyProvide a mechanism for anyone to ask for helpDiscuss issues in an open forumProvide cloud-based environments to allow external participants to contribute and test changes to featuresConsider the opportunities that cloud computing brings as a means to enable shared management of the infrastructure.Promote the sharing of knowledge around big data technologies amongst partners, using cloud computing as a training environmentInvest in standards compliance and work with standards organisations to develop new, and extend existing standardsReport on and review standards compliance within an infrastructure with metrics that give credit for work on standard compliance and developmentProvide as many different modalities of access as possibleAvoid requiring personal contacts to download dataProvide a full description of an API and the data it servesFinally, the hackathons were an ideal meeting opportunity to build, diversify and extend the BiCIKL community further, and to ensure the alignment of the community with a common vision on how best to link data from specimens, samples, sequences, taxonomic names and taxonomic literature.",

    "abstract": "This chapter presents the potential of interoperability and standardised data publication for cultural heritage resources, with a focus on community-driven approaches and web standards for usability. The Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) design principles, which rely on JSON-LD as lingua franca, serve as the foundation. We begin by exploring the significant advances made by the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) in promoting interoperability for image-based resources. The principles and practices of IIIF have paved the way for Linked Art, which expands the use of linked data by demonstrating how it can easily facilitate the integration and sharing of semantic cultural heritage data across portals and institutions. To provide a practical demonstration of the concepts discussed, the chapter highlights the implementation of LUX, the Yale Collections Discovery platform. LUX serves as a compelling case study for the use of linked data at scale, demonstrating the real-world application of automated enrichment in the cultural heritage domain. Rooted in empirical study, the analysis presented in this chapter delves into the broader context of community practices and semantic interoperability. By examining the collaborative efforts and integration of diverse cultural heritage resources, the research sheds light on the potential benefits and challenges associated with LOUD.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge use and production is complex and so also are attempts to judge its quality. Research synthesis is a set of formal processes to determine what is known from research in relation to different research questions and this process requires judgements of the quality and relevance of the research evidence considered. Such judgement can be according to generic standards or be specific to the review question. The judgements interact with other judgements in the review process such as inclusion criteria and search strategies and can be absolute or weighted judgements combined in a Weight of Evidence framework. Judgements also vary depending upon the type of review that can range from statistical meta analysis to meta ethnography. Empirical study of the ways that quality and relevance judgements are made can illuminate the nature of such decisions and their impact on epistemic and other domains of knowledge. Greater clarity about such ideological and theoretical differences can enable greater participative debates about such differences.",

To encourage our readers to create LOD, we have developed a workflow for the enrichment of datasets taken from analog and digital sources by interlinking and publishing them in Wikidata. This paper will discuss the main principles of LOD, as well as current attitudes towards it in the digital humanities. Our vision for LOD has lead us to create SPARQL Unicorn, a series of tools designed to make Wikidata easier to use. As an example of SPARQL Unicorn in action, the second half of our paper will describe the Wikidata integration of the inscriptions found on the early medieval Ogham stones. Sources, workflow, tools, and data models will be explained in detail, as two examples of (geo-) statistical analysis showcase the benefits of enriched LOD to researchers. © 2022 CEUR-WS.

    "abstract": "From the perspective of sociological theory, Foucault’s concepts of power, power-knowledge, and discipline are one-sided. While Foucault contends that there is no center of power, his account of power remains top-down or structural, missing the interactive and enabling aspects of power. A more balanced view would suggest that all exercises of power include meaningful agency (the ability to do something); social structures (not simply as constraints but as interactive creations); social knowledge (including both reifying truth claims and enabling truth or knowledge); and social-ontological being-in-the-social-world (both as enabling and dominating).",

    "abstract": "Abstract: The paper examines Michel Foucault’s theory of the practices of the self and its contribution to the emergence of a new philosophical anthropology. It is focused on Foucault’s analysis of the history of practices of the self in Christianity, mainly of the practices of confession and of pastoral power, paying special attention to his critique of the Western “morality of asceticism” and “self-renunciation” as a form of control of individuals and domination. Foucault saw an alternative in Hellenistic model of practices of the self, which inspired him to sketch an ethics of taking care of oneself as a practice of freedom. Taking care of the self always aims for the well-being of others, which implies that power relations should be managed in a nonauthoritarian manner. The postulate of this morality was that free persons properly care for themselves are able to relate properly to others. Foucault’s theory is considered an important step toward a new philosophical anthropology. Its further development is traced in “synergic anthropology” based on the spiritual tradition and practices of Eastern Orthodox Christian hesychasm. In the world spiritual traditions, despite their differences, spiritual practices share some universal ontological and anthropological elements. The universal elements of spiritual practices can facilitate communication among people from different religious backgrounds and dialogue between their respective traditions. The practices of the self and spiritual practices, philosophically conceptualized in a new anthropology, promote the ideas of human freedom, justice, and peace.",

The second looks at definitions of online community as well as the ways in which the term has been used across a wide range of contexts, covering issues of attachment, emotion, community strength, motivation for participation, and relationship to technology. The third provides a general definition of online community around six key elements: commitment; connection to others; reciprocity; interaction; agency and consequences. The paper sensitises practitioners and researchers to the contested nature of community and provides a definition that is both broad and complex.",

Informal groups and networks present good opportunities for information exchange. Communities of practice (CoPs), which have been described by Wenger and others as a type of informal learning organization, have received increasing attention in the health care sector; however, the lack of uniform operating definitions of CoPs has resulted in considerable variation in the structure and function of these groups, making it difficult to evaluate their effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Community participation in health promotion is one of the central tenets of the WHO’s Health For All strategy. Throughout the United Kingdom, “Health For All” projects have been established and efforts dedicated to the pursuit of community participation in health promotion. Despite this zeal, the deceptively simple notion of “community” is one of the most contested in the social sciences. Taking this as its point of departure, this paper reviews the meanings of “community” in social sciences and health literatures. Based on empirical data, it then explores meanings of “community” for people who are involved in generating community participation in health promotion in the context of four U.K. Health For All projects. A wide variety of different meanings are found; what they share in common is that they are each constructed by people who regard themselves as “non-members” of these “communities” and that the views of the putative “members” are not taken into account in their construction. This substantially differs from meanings of community constructed by their “members”, as represented by Anthony Cohen, where community members’ perceptions of sharing are central to the delineation of boundaries. This paper argues that there is a fundamental difference between the construction of communities by “members” and “non-members”. In the former case notions are sharing are integral to the construction, in the latter case they are assumed. In the final part of the paper we examine informants daily experiences of operationalising the “communities” which they construct and argue that commonly their assumptions of sharing prove unfounded. We conclude by arguing that recognition of the differences in the construction of communities by members and non-members is essential, not least because it demands a fundamental rethinking of the notion of community participation in health.",

    "abstract": "IFLA Library Reference Model (LRM) is a high-level conceptual reference model developed within an entity-relationship modelling framework. It is the consolidation of the separately developed IFLA conceptual models: FRBR, FRAD, FRSAD. IFLA LRM was developed to resolve inconsistencies between the three separate models. Every user task, entity, attribute and relationship from the original three models was examined, definitions had to be revised, but also some remodelling was required in order to develop a meaningful consolidation. The result is a single, streamlined, and logically consistent model that covers all aspects of bibliographic data and that at the same time brings the modelling up-to-date with current conceptual modelling practices. IFLA LRM was designed to be used in linked data environments and to support and promote the use of bibliographic data in linked data environments.",

    "abstract": "Creative industries play an important role in today’s economy, being sources of growth that boost future development. Their products have a huge potential to be re-used and re-purposed, while at the same time they can enrich and improve the design process and create newly exploitable content. This short paper presents V4Link, a semantic annotation and linking framework of multimodal annotations deriving from visual and textual analysis of digital content. The framework reuses the Web Annotation Data Model to capture the annotations, while it semantically enriches the generated knowledge graphs by defining links to Linked Datasets, offering to users advanced query capabilities beyond the ones that can be supported on top of the initial multimodal knowledge base. We illustrate the capabilities of the framework presenting a number of use cases that inspire and support the design, architecture, as well as the 3D and VR game creative industries.",

    "abstract": "The W3C Data on the Web Best Practices Working Group is standardizing the Data Quality Vocabulary (DQV) for expressing data quality of Web-published datasets. As proposed in the DQV specification, quality annotations on datasets, one kind of quality information described using DQV, are achieved through Web annotations. Meanwhile, the W3C Web Annotation Working Group is creating a standard Web Annotation Data Model on the basis of the Open Annotation (OA) Data Model. Despite the significant progress in standardization, there is a lack of systematic research on Web tools for DQV-based dataset quality annotation. This paper therefore proposes a Dataset Quality Annotation Framework (DQAF) that provides annotating users with an interactive visual user interface, through which DQV-based dataset quality annotation can be readily achieved using the OA data model to produce machine-readable quality annotation data. We have implemented a proof-of-concept prototype of DQAF and conducted case study experiments with the prototype. The results indicate that DQAF is feasible and implementable, and annotating users can obtain a better understanding of and more intuitive interaction with the quality annotation data by means of the user interface.",

    "abstract": "Beside transmitting musical meaning from composer to reader, symbolic music notation affords the dynamic addition of layers of information by annotation. This allows music scores to serve as rudimentary communication frameworks. Music encodings bring these affordances into the digital realm; though annotations may be represented as digital pen-strokes upon a score image, they must be captured using machine-interpretable semantics to fully benefit from this transformation. This is challenging, as annotators’ requirements are heterogeneous, varying both across different types of user (e.g., musician, scholar) and within these groups, depending on the specific use-case. A hypothetical all-encompassing tool catering to every conceivable annotation type, even if it were possible to build, would vastly complicate user interaction. This additional complexity would significantly increase cognitive load and impair usability, particularly in dynamic real-time usage contexts, e.g., live annotation during music rehearsal or performance. To address this challenge, we present a social data infrastructure that facilitates the creation of use-case specific annotation toolkits. Its components include a selectable-score module that supports customisable click-and-drag selection of score elements (e.g., notes, measures, directives); the Web Annotations data model, extended to support the creation of custom, Web-addressable annotation types supporting the specification and (re-)use of annotation palettes; and the Music Encoding and Linked Data (MELD) Javascript client library, used to build interfaces that map annotation types to rendering and interaction handlers. We have extended MELD to support the Solid platform for social Linked Data, allowing annotations to be privately stored in user-controlled Personal Online Datastores (Pods), or selectively shared or published. To demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed approach, we present annotation interfaces employing the outlined infrastructure in three distinct use-cases: scholarly communication; music rehearsal; and rating during music listening.",

    "abstract": "Sparked by issues of quality and lack of proper documentation for datasets, the machine learning community has begun developing standardised processes for establishing datasheets for machine learning datasets, with the intent to provide context and information on provenance, purposes, composition, the collection process, recommended uses or societal biases reflected in training datasets. This approach fits well with practices and procedures established in GLAM institutions, such as establishing collections&rsquo; descriptions. However, digital cultural heritage datasets are marked by specific characteristics. They are often the product of multiple layers of selection; they may have been created for different purposes than establishing a statistical sample according to a specific research question; they change over time and are heterogeneous. Punctuated by a series of recommendations to create datasheets for digital cultural heritage, the paper addresses the scope and characteristics of digital cultural heritage datasets; possible metrics and measures; lessons from concepts similar to datasheets and/or established workflows in the cultural heritage sector. This paper includes a proposal for a datasheet template that has been adapted for use in cultural heritage institutions, and which proposes to incorporate information on the motivation and selection criteria, digitisation pipeline, data provenance, the use of linked open data, and version information.",

It presents the key characteristics and consequences of the digital turn and identifies fields of action for the DFG. The major impact of digital technologies can be explained by two main factors: a rapid growth in research data and a strong increase in the use of software. The DFG will intensify its engagement in supporting the scientific communities to make use of the new technologies.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study is to offer a checklist that can be used for both creating and evaluating digital collections, which are also sometimes referred to as data sets as part of the collections as data movement, suitable for computational use. Design/methodology/approach The checklist was built by synthesising and analysing the results of relevant research literature, articles and studies and the issues and needs obtained in an observational study. The checklist was tested and applied both as a tool for assessing a selection of digital collections made available by galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAM) institutions as proof of concept and as a supporting tool for creating collections as data. Findings Over the past few years, there has been a growing interest in making available digital collections published by GLAM organisations for computational use. Based on previous work, the authors defined a methodology to build a checklist for the publication of Collections as data. The authors’ evaluation showed several examples of applications that can be useful to encourage other institutions to publish their digital collections for computational use. Originality/value While some work on making available digital collections suitable for computational use exists, giving particular attention to data quality, planning and experimentation, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, none of the work to date provides an easy-to-follow and robust checklist to publish collection data sets in GLAM institutions. This checklist intends to encourage small- and medium-sized institutions to adopt the collection as data principles in daily workflows following best practices and guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Annotations allow users to associate additional information with existing resources. Using proprietary and closed systems on the Web, users are already able to annotate multimedia resources such as images, audio and video. So far, however, this information is almost always kept locked up and inaccessible to the Web of Data. We believe that an important step to take is the integration of multimedia annotations and the Linked Data principles. This should allow clients to easily publish and consume, thus exchange annotations about resources via commonWeb standards.We first present the current status of the Open Annotation Collaboration, an international initiative that is currently working on annotation interoperability specifications based on best practices from the Linked Data effort. Then we present two use cases and early prototypes that make use of the proposed annotation model and present lessons learned and discuss yet open technical issues.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present a model based on the principles of Linked Data that can be used to describe the interrelationships of images, texts and other resources to facilitate the interoperability of repositories of medieval manuscripts or other culturally important handwritten documents. The model is designed from a set of requirements derived from the real world use cases of some of the largest digitized medieval content holders, and instantiations of the model are intended as the input to collection-independent page turning and scholarly presentation interfaces. A canvas painting paradigm, such as in PDF and SVG, was selected based on the lack of a one to one correlation between image and page, and to fulfill complex requirements such as when the full text of a page is known, but only fragments of the physical object remain. The model is implemented using technologies such as OAI-ORE Aggregations and OAC Annotations, as the fundamental building blocks of emerging Linked Digital Libraries. The model and implementation are evaluated through prototypes of both content providing and consuming applications. Although the system was designed from requirements drawn from the medieval manuscript domain, it is applicable to any layout-oriented presentation of images of text.",

    "abstract": "A four-valued description logic has been proposed to reason with description logic based inconsistent knowledge bases. This approach has a distinct advantage that it can be implemented by invoking classical reasoners to keep the same complexity as under the classical semantics. However, this approach has so far only been studied for the basic description logic $\\mathcal{ALC}$. In this paper, we further study how to extend the four-valued semantics to the more expressive description logic $\\mathcal{SROIQ}$which underlies the forthcoming revision of the Web Ontology Language, OWL 2, and also investigate how it fares when adapted to tractable description logics including $\\mathcal{EL++}$, DL-Lite, and Horn-DLs. We define the four-valued semantics along the same lines as for $\\mathcal{ALC}$and show that we can retain most of the desired properties.",

    "abstract": "L’histoire de la restauration de Notre-Dame de Paris est généralement racontée selon les points de vue des différents acteurs : les tailleurs de pierre, les conservateurs, les architectes. Cette contribution propose d’inverser la perspective du récit et de se placer depuis le point de vue de deux claveaux issus de l’arc doubleau démoli par l’incendie. Ainsi, le récit biographique de deux claveaux est présenté dans toute la singularité de leur trajectoire : en élévation, en chute, enfoui sous les déblais, nettoyé, dépollué, numérisé, abstrait dans un inventaire, étudié et observé, annoté et identifié sur des images, restitué, retaillé, carotté, restauré, etc. Les objets sont replacés au centre du récit, en tant qu’acteurs à part entière de l’histoire de Notre-Dame. Ce travail s’inscrit dans la continuité théorique d’assemblage social (DeLanda), de l’Object-Oriented Ontology (Harman), de l’Acteur-Réseau-Théorie (Latour) et l’approche biographique en matérialité culturelle (Kopytoff). Il s’en distingue par la spécificité de ces trajectoires, tantôt fluctuantes par leur position dans l’espace ou dans le temps, tantôt intermittentes dans leurs représentations physiques et numériques. Le récit non-linéaire résultant de ces trajectoires favorise l’utilisation des méthodes issues des sciences de l’information, notamment le mapping, la représentation conceptuelle et l’enrichissement de métadonnées. En retissant les liens entre des jeux de données hétérogènes et imperméables, la trame narrative prend alors la forme de visualisations en graphe de requêtes pour des Linked Open Data (LOD). Les liens sémantiques sont retracés pour reconstituer l’histoire du claveau à partir de ses données.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation services are, for now, a necessary reality in the world of linked open data. This chapter looks at some of the benefits and tradeoffs that come with the aggregation of linked open data, before looking at the specific case of the Swedish Open Cultural Heritage (SOCH) national aggregator. By gathering disparate but thematically related data sets and republishing them in a common format, aggregators not only make data more accessible and discoverable, but also place it within a wider context. However, there are concomitant design compromises which must be made. SOCH is a national aggregator for heritage data in Sweden. Since 2010 it has harvested data from museums, archives and historic environment registers, and published them as linked open data mapped to a common data model and made them questionable via a web application programming interface (API). SOCH now aggregates more than 9 million records from more than 75 Swedish heritage institutions. Over its ten-year lifespan, SOCH has had significant success in opening up Swedish heritage data. However, as an early adopter of linked open data in Swedish heritage, there are nonetheless challenges to be addressed in future development.",

    "abstract": "The cultural heritage sector has traditionally been concerned with sharing resources and furthering human knowledge, with particular interest to the issues associated with metadata and interoperability, especially when it comes to the use of technology. These goals and interests in the cultural heritage sector are natural alignments with those of linked data; hence. there has been an increasing interest in the application of linked data in this sector. This article studies the implementation of linked data in the cultural heritage sector, through a systematic literature review of case studies of linked data implementation projects in this sector. The results reflect on the parties involved, the level of collaboration, and the motivation behind these projects. The study suggests that universities and national institutions were the main players in implementing such technologies in the cultural heritage sector, suggesting that there may be some barriers preventing smaller GLAM institutions from implementing linked data projects. The results further suggest that many linked data projects in this sector were primarily exploratory projects, and often performed in a collaborative manner. They further indicate that the most common motivating factors behind these projects were research needs, a desire to contribute to linked data as a movement, and other specific user needs. Reflecting on this systematic literature review, this article makes a set of recommendations for future work to increase the use of linked data in the cultural heritage sector and to remove barriers to adoption.",

Online databases such as Pro Quest, Science Direct, Emerald and JSTORE were also used to find the relevant literature of the study. Databases of Library Sciences Library and Information Science and Technology Abstracts and Library Information Science Abstracts were also used to find the relevant literature of the study. Library, linked data technologies, Semantic Web, digital library and digital collections were the main keywords which were used to find the relevant literature for the study. Findings The evolution of linked data technologies and Semantic Web has changed the traditional role of the libraries. Traditional libraries are converting into digital libraries and digital libraries are in a struggle to publish their resources on the Web using XML-based metadata standards. It has made capable the digital collections to be viewed by machines on the Web just like human. On the emergence of linked data applications in digital libraries, Web visibility of the libraries has been enhanced to provide the opportunities for the users to find their required quality information of libraries round-the-clock on the Web. National Library of France, National Library of Spain, Europeana, Digital Public Library of Americana, Library of Congress and The British Library have taken the initiatives to publish their resources on the Web using linked data technologies. Originality/value This study present several key issues for policy makers, software developers, decision makers and library administrators about linked data technologies and its implementations in digital libraries. The present study may play its role to facilitate the users of the Web who are enthusiastically interested to exploit the quality and authentic library resources on the Web round-the-clock. Search engines will also achieve their longstanding goal to exploit the quality resources of the libraries for their Web users to make their Web appearance more credible and trustworthy.",

Traditional keyword searching is inaccurate, and its limitations have been noted for several years. We propose a combination method of WADL and a learning ontology mechanism to enable RESTful semantic web services. These syntactic and semantic descriptions allow search engines to support a similarity search for RESTful web services. We describe an experimental study on a collection of 168 RESTful web services. The experimental results show that our method has higher performance in terms both of the rate of recall and precision compared to existing methods.",

    "abstract": "A client/server application is characterized by the existence of more than one “place” to locate software components. Also, when compared with a centralized application, we need to partition client/server application constituents into smaller components. Because of these features, organizing and partitioning application components becomes a very important design consideration. In this endeavour, we must:1.In client/server environments, costs break down differently to that of centralized mainframe computing. As mentioned in the Introduction, surveys on the costs of client/server computing suggest that the typical cost of hardware is about 20 per cent, while the other 80 per cent represents maintenance, integration, upgrade, support, training etc. There is also growing evidence that client/server computing could well result in higher overall costs than centralized computing. Indeed, the push for network computing as well as centrally administered systems stems from a recognition (even among the vendors!) of this phenomenon. Currently there is a debate in the industry about the relative merits of these different technology solutions. While the right technology is important, we must not neglect the application: in constructing applications, there are certain things we can do to contain the effort and cost of maintenance and support. In keeping with the theme of this book, we concentrate on these application level solutions. We can guard against the proliferation of application components and the ensuing complexity in the following ways.",

    "abstract": "Service oriented architecture (SOA) is a paradigm for organizing a set of capabilities, often distributed across the network and possibly under the control of different ownership domains. The organized capabilities can be used to provide solutions to business problems. A business problem is broadly defined as any problem, in any domain of interest, encountered by an individual or organization as it goes about its business. SOA is applied to business problems that are amenable to information technology solutions. Services are made visible to potential users, interact with users through a series of information exchanges, and produce real-world effects. Invocation and information exchange rely on standard languages and protocols that facilitate interoperability. From a user’s perspective, invoking a service to produce an intended effect is experienced as a single, atomic operation. The detailed sequence of actions carried out by the service may involve any number of operations such as database queries, data transformations, execution of models, and formatting of displays. These operations may themselves be composed of lower level operations. The data and/or software modules required to perform the operations may reside at different physical locations and be controlled by different organizations. The details of composing the sequence of actions that produces the real world effect are transparent to the user interacting with the service. SOA frees users to concentrate on their business problem, leaving the details of the solution to the service. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

    "abstract": "Digital scholarship offers the opportunity to move beyond the limitations of traditional scholarly publication. Rather than limiting scholarly communication to text-based static documents, the Web makes it possible for scholars to expose and share the full evidence of their research including data, images, video, and other genre of materials. These aggregations of evidence, or compound documents, can then be integrated into a linked data cloud, the basis of Scholarship 2.0—an open environment in which scholars collaborate and build new knowledge on the existing scholarship.

    "abstract": "Data repository infrastructures for academics have appeared in waves since the dawn of Web technology. These waves are driven by changes in societal needs, archiving needs and the development of cloud computing resources. As such, the data repository landscape has many flavors when it comes to sustainability models, target audiences and feature sets. One thing that links all data repositories is a desire to make the content they host reusable, building on the core principles of cataloging content for economical and research speed efficiency. The FAIR principles are a common goal for all repository infrastructures to aim for. No matter what discipline or infrastructure, the goal of reusable content, for both humans and machines, is a common one. This is the first time that repositories can work toward a common goal that ultimately lends itself to interoperability. The idea that research can move further and faster as we un-silo these fantastic resources is an achievable one. This paper investigates the steps that existing repositories need to take in order to remain useful and relevant in a FAIR research world.",

For every sharing transaction, a successful data exchange is produced between a data consumer and a data provider. Providers of human genomic data (e.g., publicly or privately funded repositories and data archives) fulfil their social contract with data donors when their shareable data conforms to FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles. Based on our experiences via Repositive (https://repositive.io), a leading discovery platform cataloguing all shared human genomic datasets, we propose guidelines for data providers wishing to maximise their shared data’s FAIRness.",

    "abstract": "Research can be more transparent and collaborative by using Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles to publish Earth and environmental science data. Reporting formats—instructions, templates, and tools for consistently formatting data within a discipline—can help make data more accessible and reusable. However, the immense diversity of data types across Earth science disciplines makes development and adoption challenging. Here, we describe 11 community reporting formats for a diverse set of Earth science (meta)data including cross-domain metadata (dataset metadata, location metadata, sample metadata), file-formatting guidelines (file-level metadata, CSV files, terrestrial model data archiving), and domain-specific reporting formats for some biological, geochemical, and hydrological data (amplicon abundance tables, leaf-level gas exchange, soil respiration, water and sediment chemistry, sensor-based hydrologic measurements). More broadly, we provide guidelines that communities can use to create new (meta)data formats that integrate with their scientific workflows. Such reporting formats have the potential to accelerate scientific discovery and predictions by making it easier for data contributors to provide (meta)data that are more interoperable and reusable.",

    "abstract": "The FAIR principles have been widely cited, endorsed and adopted by a broad range of stakeholders since their publication in 2016. By intention, the 15 FAIR guiding principles do not dictate specific technological implementations, but provide guidance for improving Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability of digital resources. This has likely contributed to the broad adoption of the FAIR principles, because individual stakeholder communities can implement their own FAIR solutions. However, it has also resulted in inconsistent interpretations that carry the risk of leading to incompatible implementations. Thus, while the FAIR principles are formulated on a high level and may be interpreted and implemented in different ways, for true interoperability we need to support convergence in implementation choices that are widely accessible and (re)-usable. We introduce the concept of FAIR implementation considerations to assist accelerated global participation and convergence towards accessible, robust, widespread and consistent FAIR implementations. Any self-identified stakeholder community may either choose to reuse solutions from existing implementations, or when they spot a gap, accept the challenge to create the needed solution, which, ideally, can be used again by other communities in the future. Here, we provide interpretations and implementation considerations (choices and challenges) for each FAIR principle.",

    "abstract": "This practice paper describes an ongoing research project to test the effectiveness and relevance of the FAIR Data Principles. Simultaneously, it will analyse how easy it is for data archives to adhere to the principles. The research took place from November 2016 to January 2017, and will be underpinned with feedback from the repositories. The FAIR Data Principles feature 15 facets corresponding to the four letters of FAIR - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable. These principles have already gained traction within the research world. The European Commission has recently expanded its demand for research to produce open data. The relevant guidelines1are explicitly written in the context of the FAIR Data Principles. Given an increasing number of researchers will have exposure to the guidelines, understanding their viability and suggesting where there may be room for modification and adjustment is of vital importance. This practice paper is connected to a dataset(Dunning et al.,2017) containing the original overview of the sample group statistics and graphs, in an Excel spreadsheet. Over the course of two months, the web-interfaces, help-pages and metadata-records of over 40 data repositories have been examined, to score the individual data repository against the FAIR principles and facets. The traffic-light rating system enables colour-coding according to compliance and vagueness. The statistical analysis provides overall, categorised, on the principles focussing, and on the facet focussing results. The analysis includes the statistical and descriptive evaluation, followed by elaborations on Elements of the FAIR Data Principles, the subject specific or repository specific differences, and subsequently what repositories can do to improve their information architecture.(1) H2020 Guidelines on FAIR Data Management:http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/oa_pilot/h2020-hi-oa-data-mgt_en.pdf",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT We observe a growing universe of machine‐readable knowledge organisation systems (KOS) or even wider ‘semantic artifacts. We see at the same time, various attempts to bring semantic artifacts together via registries, catalogues and via cross‐walks among ontologies. This poster reflects how newest research on semantic interoperability informs current practice for research data repositories and registry service providers. We focus on the domain of humanities and cultural heritage, using different examples from Europe and the Netherlands: The European Archaeological Data Infrastructure Ariadne, services of the Dutch Cultural Heritage Network and two Data Stations (for Archaeology and for SSH) hosted at DANS‐KNAW. For those cases we report on current efforts to include “semantic artifacts”, together with opportunities and challenges. This poster is a practice report combined with an invitation to reflect about the context of semantic interoperability itself.",

    "abstract": "Within volunteered geographic information (VGI), citizen science stands out as a class of activities that require special attention and analysis. Citizen science is likely to be the longest running of VGI activities, with some projects showing continuous effort over a century. In addition, many projects are characterised by a genuine element of volunteering and contribution of information for the benefit of human knowledge and science. They are also tasks where data quality and uncertainty come to the fore when evaluating the validity of the results. This chapter provides an overview of citizen science in the context of VGI – hence the focus on geographic citizen science. This chapter highlights the historical context of citizen science and its more recent incarnation. It also covers some of the cultural and conceptual challenges that citizen science faces and the resulting limitation on the level of engagement. By drawing parallels with the Participatory Geographic Information Systems (PGIS) literature, the chapter offers a framework for participation in citizen science and concludes with the suggestion that a more participatory mode of citizen science is possible.",

    "abstract": "Is public engagement with science an effective response to threats against science? One form of public engagement—citizen science—might be especially useful for addressing issues of inequality that threaten public support for science. Citizen science is both public participation in the scientific process and public participation in the governance of science. In principle, citizen science empowers marginalized communities to participate in the scientific process, using the authority of science to challenge government, industry, or other institutions that exploit imbalances of social power. In practice, however, citizen science can also be used to redirect attention away from actions that address inequalities and to reinforce modes of knowledge production that exclude alternative ways of knowing relevant to those without social power. Thus, rhetoric about citizen science as a solution to threats against science needs to be tempered with attention to specific contexts and opportunities.",

    "abstract": "In this chapter, we address the perennial question of what is citizen science? by asking the related question, why is it challenging to define citizen science? Over the past decade and a half, we have seen the emergence of typologies, definitions, and criteria for qualifying citizen science. Yet, citizen science as a field seems somewhat resistant to obeying a limited set of definitions and instead attracts discussions about what type of activities and practices should be included in it. We explore how citizen science has been defined differently, depending on the context. We do that from a particularly European perspective, where the variety of national and subnational structures has also led to a diversity of practices. Based on this background, we track trade-offs linked to the prioritisation of these different objectives and aims of citizen science. Understanding these differences and their origin is important for practitioners and policymakers. We pay attention to the need for definitions and criteria for specific contexts and how people in different roles can approach the issue of what is included in a specific interpretation of citizen science.",

    "abstract": "Open science refers to both the practices and norms of more open and transparent communication and research in scientific disciplines and the discourse on these practices and norms. There is no such discourse dedicated to the humanities. Though the humanities appear to be less coherent as a cluster of scholarship than the sciences are, they do share unique characteristics which lead to distinct scholarly communication and research practices. A discourse on making these practices more open and transparent needs to take account of these characteristics. The prevalent scientific perspective in the discourse on more open practices does not do so, which confirms that the discourse’s name, open science, indeed excludes the humanities so that talking about open science in the humanities is incoherent. In this paper, I argue that there needs to be a dedicated discourse for more open research and communication practices in the humanities, one that integrates several elements currently fragmented into smaller, unconnected discourses (such as on open access, preprints, or peer review). I discuss three essential elements of open science—preprints, open peer review practices, and liberal open licences—in the realm of the humanities to demonstrate why a dedicated open humanities discourse is required.",

    "abstract": "This article presents a more human, dynamic, and holistic perspective of cultural heritage, closely referring to the currently observed changes in its conceptual development. It argues that the conceptual focus of cultural heritage has shifted alongside three interrelated and complementary directions: 1) from monuments to people; 2) from objects to functions; and thus 3) from preservation per se to purposeful preservation, sustainable use, and development. The reappearing and alive functional heritage is discussed as opposed to the objectified, glass-covered, and frozen heritage of the past by referring to both practical and theoretical heritage domains. Conclusions are drawn in favor of an adequate reexamination and readaptation of the conceptual framework of cultural heritage, based on accepting its new functional socioeconomic dimension and integrating multiple perspectives from a variety of academic fields.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS: I would like to thank Alexander Bauer and an anonymous reviewer for their valuable comments on this article.",

    "abstract": "We receive communal legacies from two sources—the natural environment and the creations of human beings. To be sure, these inheritances everywhere commingle; no aspect of nature is unimpacted by human agency, no artefact devoid of environmental impress. Yet we have traditionally dealt quite differently with these two kinds of legacy. Though management of both heritages has many features in common, and both realms often share similar, if not the same, leaders and spokesmen, relations between the two are marked less by cooperative amity than by envy and rivalry. This essay discusses the reasons for our dissimilar approaches to nature and culture, and shows how they bear on the campaigns to protect and preserve each. In some important ways, the history, politics, and rhetoric of conservation and destruction are shown to have converged, in others to have diverged, over the last half century.",

    "abstract": "This keynote address for the 2014 Digital Humanities conference is a practitioner’s talk, and—though the abstract belies it—an optimistic one. I take as given the evidence that human beings are irrevocably altering the conditions for life on Earth and that, despite certain unpredictabilities, we live at the cusp of a mass extinction. What is the place of digital humanities (DH) practice in the new social and geological era of the Anthropocene? What are the DH community’s most significant responsibilities, and to whom? This talk positions itself in deep time, but strives for a foothold in the vital here-and-now of service to broad publics. From the presentist, emotional aesthetics of Dark Mountain to the arms-length futurism of the Long Now, I dwell on concepts of graceful degradation, preservation, memorialization, apocalypse, ephemerality, and minimal computing. I discuss digital recovery and close reading of texts and artifacts once thought lost forever, and the ways that prosopography, graphesis, and distant reading open new vistas on the longue durée. Can DH develop a practical ethics of resilience and repair? Can it become more humane while working at inhuman scales? Can we resist narratives of progress, and still progress? I wish to open community discussion about the practice of DH, and what to give, in the face of a great hiatus or the end of it all.",

Les diverses organisations qui ont mis à profit ces spécifications, autant des solutions techniques que sociales, ont largement contribué à la valorisation des données du patrimoine cutlurel et ont ouvert de nouvelles possibilités aux utilisateurs, en particulier en répondant aussi bien aux besoins de la communauté scientifique qu’à ceux des développeurs de logiciels. A titre d’exemple, le projet de recherche « Pratiques de connaissance participatives dans les archives d’images analogiques et numériques » (PIA) est présenté. Celui-ci souhaite tirer parti de IIIF, WADM et Linked Art au sein du modèle de données dans le cadre d’une initiative de science citoyenne axée sur trois collections des archives photographiques de la société suisse des traditions populaires (SSTP). Grâce à ce socle technologique mettant en pratique le LOUD, PIA permettra ainsi une utilisation participative des archives offrant des possibilités aux différents publics cibles de contextualiser, relier, contraster et annoter les images et leurs métadonnées associées.",

    "abstract": "Academic research in the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) collects considerable amounts of relevant, curated, high-quality information in form of digital data, in order to produce new knowledge about different aspects of the past and present human societies. Whereas natural sciences have developed best practices and workflows for research data publication and re-use, there is a limited practice in this regard in the HSS. In this domain, a lot of valuable data is collected but there is a lack of (a) standardized knowledge representation languages (ontologies) to document the meaning of data and (b) virtual research environments (VRE) facilitating collaborative data production, publication and reuse. Instead, spread-sheets and more or less sophisticated information systems are employed, which often leads to data loss at the end of the project or results in a long-term archiving of data whose semantics is not made explicit and/or the model strictly focused on the specific research approach and therefore hardly reusable. Hence, current established practices in HSS for data production are mostly not in line with the FAIR principles and the used infrastructure often not fully sustainable. This leads to limited open research data (ORD) practices in this area. In the meantime, digitization of research becomes a more and more important topic in scientific disciplines. Agencies like SNSF, ANR and Horizon Europe ask funded research projects to detail how the produced data respond to the FAIR principles. Furthermore, universities increasingly include data management courses in their curricula. This trend increases the awareness of the academic domain for the need of standardization and best practices in producing and reusing research data. To cope with these issues, the Digital History Research Team of “Laboratoire de Recherche Historique Rhône-Alpes” (LARHRA), building on its several-year-long experience with the symogih.org project, and the IT-startup KleioLab based in Basel initiated a new approach, which is further developed by an academic consortium around the University of Bern, supported by swissuniversities. This approach, on the one side, consists of OntoME (https://ontome.net), a collaborative ontology management environment focusing on semantic interoperability, developed by LARHRA in order to foster distributed data management and data reuse using semantic web technologies. OntoME supports the development of an ecosystem of domain related extensions of the CIDOC CRM ontology (ISO 21127). Of particular relevance in OntoME is the “Semantic Data for Humanities and Social Sciences” ontology ecosystem (sdhss.org), which ensures coherence between research models from different projects in HSS, at different levels of abstraction (Beretta 2021, 2022). In parallel, the Data for History initiative was launched, with a first international conference held in 20211 (Beretta/Alamercery 2020). On the other side, a new VRE and data publication platform, Geovistory (https://www.geovistory.org), has been created in the context of a public-private joint venture between LARHRA and KleioLab. Thus, Geovistory builds on LARHRA’s longstanding experience in collaborative modelling and ORD management but is structured as a public-private initiative and therefore more independent and can easily respond to researchers’ needs from all over Europe. Geovistory combines different features that make it an attractive tool to strengthen ORD practices. To begin with, it has been developed according to “user experience methodologies”. Also, each research project works on its own data perspective but at the same time automatically contributes to the joint knowledge graph. A particular strength of Geovistory is its handling of the challenges of scientific information in HSS: The context-sensitive nature of information and its relation to different research agendas, the wide variations in meaning for the same terms and vocabulary complexities, competing views or gaps and fragmentation of available information. This is what makes the Geovistory graph data model and semantic enrichment capabilities so interesting for HSS research. Importantly, the data model is collaboratively managed in OntoME and takes advantage of the sdhss.org project and the available, extensible application profiles for different HSS domains. Already existing profiles for basic biographical data, social activities, concepts of laws and customs, archeology, etc. can be extended with application profiles such as the treatment of dramatic works and literature, vocabularies for sociology and political science, concepts used in linguistics, etc. The possibility of extending the ontology as needed thanks to a robust and modular modelling method allows Geovistory to be proposed as VRE to researchers in different HSS disciplines, thus facilitating the collection of information about past and present societies. Finally, Geovistory allows publishing each project’s data on project-specific webpage and dedicated sparql-endpoint, making it an interesting tool not only for data production, but also publication. The poster highlights the workflow proposed in the OntoME-Geovistory environment.

    "abstract": "Citizen science enlists the public in collecting large quantities of data across an array of habitats and locations over long spans of time. Citizen science projects have been remarkably successful in advancing scientific knowledge, and contributions from citizen scientists now provide a vast quantity of data about species occurrence and distribution around the world. Most citizen science projects also strive to help participants learn about the organisms they are observing and to experience the process by which scientific investigations are conducted. Developing and implementing public data-collection projects that yield both scientific and educational outcomes requires significant effort. This article describes the model for building and operating citizen science projects that has evolved at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology over the past two decades. We hope that our model will inform the fields of biodiversity monitoring, biological research, and science education while providing a window into the culture of citizen science.",

    "abstract": "Over the last years, many projects and institutions have worked on transforming object documentation from several existing cataloguing systems into a CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC CRM) compliant graph representation, as expressed in RDF. There were also various attempts to provide a generally valid path for the transfer of data from Lightweight Information Describing Objects (LIDO), CIDOC’s recommended XML Schema for metadata harvesting, into representations that are suitable for the Semantic Web. They all face the challenge that a detailed mapping, which fully exploits the CRM’s expressiveness and requires semantic assumptions that may not always turn out to be valid. Broad mappings, on the other hand, fail to leverage the potential of Semantic Web technologies. In this paper, we propose a method for using LIDO combined with an associated terminology as a means of evolving existing object documentation into CRM-based RDF representations. By clearly distinguishing between controlled vocabulary and ontology, it is possible to transform object data relatively easily into a minimized, though efficient structure using the CIDOC CRM ontology. This structure will open up the whole world of Semantic Web technologies to be used for further semantic refinement and data quality analysis through exploiting the underlying controlled vocabularies",

The Visual Resource Association (VRA) Core 4 eXtensible Markup Language (XML) schema was used as a basis for developing a new VRA ontology that was highly interoperable across the Web. Once the model was developed, an eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT) style sheet was created to test the model against an actual VRA Core 4 data set. The study successfully demonstrated how popular and widely consumed vocabularies can be used to form the basis for more granular vocabularies.

    "abstract": "A body of cataloguing practice has coalesced around Cataloguing Cultural Objects: a Guide to Describing Cultural Works and Their Images (CCO) since its publication in 2003. CCO is a manual for describing, documenting, and cataloguing cultural works and their visual surrogates. The primary focus of CCO is art and architecture, including but not limited to paintings, sculpture, prints, manuscripts, photographs, built works, installations, and other visual media. CCO also covers many other types of cultural works, including archaeological sites, artifacts, and functional objects from the realm of material culture. This paper examines the influence of CCO and its implementation in cataloguing settings for the museum and image library community. In drawing together three diverse scenarios, the authors have identified common strategies for particular challenges in each one. The showcase projects include: (1) the development of a de facto standard for contributing cultural and natural history collections to union catalogues and digital repositories by harmonizing the CDWA Lite and museumdat XML schemas; (2) the use of CCO in the Society of Architectural Historians Architecture Resources Archive (SAHARA) project, a shared online archive of photographs that document architecture and cultural landscapes worldwide — the SAHARA project developed a cataloguing template for use by scholars and librarians; and (3) the application of CCO alongside other guidelines in records for cultural works in library settings. Emerging CCO cataloguing practice has resulted in a significant body of records from the museum and image library communities headed for LAM (library/ archive/museum) integrated access environments. The authors comment on how cataloguing decision-making (e.g. differing concepts about a “work”) may impact the convergence of records in these environments.",

An initiative of the Digital Library Federation, METS is under development by an international editorial board and is maintained in the Network Development and MARC Standards Office of the Library of Congress. Designed in conformance with the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model, a METS document encapsulates digital objects and metadata as Information Packages for transmitting and/or exchanging digital objects to and from digital repositories, disseminating digital objects via the Web, and archiving digital objects for long-term preservation and access. This paper represents an introduction to the METS standard and, through illustrated examples, how to build a METS document.",

    "abstract": "The “Advances in Library Data and Access” column examines technological advances internal and external to libraries. The focus is on how library data is created and used. The strength of the column is its broad, international focus and contributors are encouraged to explore issues and recent advances in information technology relevant to their geographical region, as well as the larger, global audience. Interested authors are invited to submit proposals and articles to the column editor at moulaisonhe@missouri.edu. Please include “IILR Submission” in the subject line of the email. Library cataloging and metadata are undergoing a major transformation. The International Federation of Library Associations and Institution’s Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records Library Reference Model, the ongoing development of Resource Description and Access, and the Library of Congress’ Bibliographic Framework initiative are the three programs currently underway which will, in all probability, profoundly affect how library bibliographic data is recorded, stored, and retrieved. These initiatives will also allow library holdings, for the first time, to be visible on the Web and discoverable for users, and, therefore, sharable with other cultural resource communities. What will library metadata look like in the next century? What knowledge and skills will be needed to navigate in this new world? Where are we headed?",

    "abstract": "Scientific and technical report is an important document type with high intelligence value. But the resource distribution of different carrier forms of scientific and technical report is not integrated and the resource description is not deeply and specific enough to the report document type, which influences the information searching accuracy and efficiency for users. Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR), an emerging model in the bibliographic domain, provides interesting possibilities in terms of cataloguing, representation and semantic enrichment of bibliographic data. This study employs the FRBR conceptual model and entity-relationship analysis method to design in-depth descriptive metadata schema of scientific and technical report by analyzing the entities and mapping the bibliographic attributes corresponding to the characteristics of report, which can help to integrating and disclosing scientific and technical report resources.",

    "abstract": "This article presents the methodology that has been successfully used over the past seven years by an interdisciplinary team to create the International Committee for Documentation of the International Council of Museums (CIDOC) CONCEPTUAL REFERENCE MODEL (CRM), a high-level ontology to enable information integration for cultural heritage data and their correlation with library and archive information. The CIDOC CRM is now in the process to become an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard. This article justifies in detail the methodology and design by functional requirements and gives examples of its contents. The CIDOC CRM analyzes the common conceptualizations behind data and metadata structures to support data transformation, mediation, and merging. It is argued that such ontologies are propertycentric, in contrast to terminological systems, and should be built with different methodologies. It is demonstrated that ontological and epistemological arguments are equally important for an effective design, in particular when dealing with knowledge from the past in any domain. It is assumed that the presented methodology and the upper level of the ontology are applicable in a far wider domain.",

    "abstract": "The MARC Pilot Project was an experiment conducted by the Library of Congress, in cooperation with 16 participating libraries, to determine the feasibility of putting cataloging data into machine-readable from for distribution of magnetic tapes. MARC (Machine Readable Cataloging) records were distributed for some 16,000 titles in the pilot phase from November 1966 through June 1967 and for additional titles in the following fiscal year while the project was in transition to an operational stage. By June 30, 1968, approximately 50,000 records had been distributed to the participants for use in the production of book catalogs, catalog cards, book selection notices, and other library tools. This final report by the project’s director contains a detailed description of the MARC pilot system, including the tape format, character sets, bibliographic codes, and input procedures. An analysis of the cost of production during the pilot period, as well as brief summaries of the computer programs used, are provided. The new MARC system which evolved from work carried out in the project and which is used for the MARC Distribution Service is also described. An appendix includes the reports and analyses of the pilot project written by the participating libraries. (LC Information Bull.)",

    "abstract": ", In 2003 the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) and Research Libraries Group (RLG) established an international working group to develop a common, implementable core set of metadata elements for digital preservation. Most published specifications for preservation-related metadata are either implementation specific or broadly theoretical. PREMIS (Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies) was charged to define a set of semantic units that are implementation independent, practically oriented, and likely to be needed by most preservation repositories. The semantic units will be represented in a data dictionary and in a METS-compatible XML schema. In the course of this work, the group also developed a glossary of terms and concepts, a data model, and a typology of relationships. Existing preservation repositories were surveyed about their architectural models and metadata practices, and some attempt was made to identify best practices. This article outlines the history and methods of the PREMIS Working Group and describes its deliverables. It explains major assumptions and decisions made by the group and examines some of the more difficult issues encountered.",

    "abstract": "Historical architectural archives enjoy attention from diverse audiences, acting as a primary source of information for architects, historians, public authorities, and common citizens alike. In Italy, the interest in architectural archives has grown slowly but steadily for the last 20 years. However, architectural archives do not generally follow the trend common for museums and galleries in publishing digitized materials and providing standard metadata for individual records. The information that is available online usually includes only an archival finding aid, instead of metadata about the individual records, or fully digital versions of the records. While cataloguing standards for archival descriptions of architectural records have existed at least since the 1980s, the rise of Linked Open Data as a framework for publishing cultural heritage data has allowed archivists to enhance these archival descriptions with richer contextual information and links to external knowledge bases. In this paper we present the ITDT ontology, an extension of the Records in Contexts Ontology that facilitates the representation of architectural records and of the context related to architectural projects, its process, and participating entities. We discuss the application of the ontology to the project files of Italian architect and engineer Dino Tamburini (1924–2011), and the creation of a digital archive offering multiple perspectives over the records.",

    "abstract": "Digital versions of the library are proliferating as information becomes ever more electronic. Traditional methods of library cataloging are inadequate to fully describe digital objects in this new dynamic environment. Thus, new standards of metadata are being devised to provide access for objects in digital libraries. These new standards extend beyond mere description; there is also a need to include other metadata functions that provide administrative, access, preservation, and structural information. This preconference provided an overview of newer metadata formats, as well as current trends in the field, and encouraged librarians to engage with their information technology partners to ensure optimal use and development of digital libraries.",

    "abstract": "Although the development and implementation of metadata schemes over the last decade has been extensive, research examining the sum of these activities is limited. This limitation is likely due to the massive scope of the topic. A framework is needed to study the full extent of, and functionalities supported by, metadata schemes. Metadata schemes developed for information resources are analyzed. To begin, the author presents a review of the definition of metadata, metadata functions, and several metadata typologies. Next, a conceptualization for metadata schemes is presented. The emphasis is on semantic container-like metadata schemes (data structures). The last part of this paper introduces the MODAL (Metadata Objectives and principles, Domains, and Architectural Layout) framework as an approach for studying metadata schemes. The paper concludes with a brief discussion on the value of frameworks for examining metadata schemes, including different types of metadata schemes.",

    "abstract": "This interdisciplinary study brings together acousticians and anthropologists to examine the memory of the acoustics of Notre-Dame de Paris before the fire of April 2019, using a qualitative approach to collect the testimonies of 18 people involved in the sound usages of the cathedral. Testimonies were analyzed in light of research conducted in the anthropology of the senses, sensory perception, memory, and cultural heritage. Analysis highlights an apparent contradiction between the remarkable acoustics of the monument before the fire and the impression of musicians. These musicians reported a struggle to tame the cathedral’s sound space, to hear each other well enough to craft their performances and to reach an acceptable level of clarity in their musical practice. These phenomena are examined with acoustic measurements and numerical simulations using a calibrated geometrical acoustics model of the cathedral before the fire, which allows for an objective exploration of the acoustic characteristics of Notre-Dame. This analysis concludes that the well-known reverberation of Notre-Dame, as well as the acoustic barrier of the transept and the poor acoustic return on the podium (the usual place for concert performers) negatively impact singers’ comfort. This highlights the tension between the original architectural design of the cathedral and its modern religious and cultural usages. However, the regular occupants have developed a deep familiarity with these constraints during their ritual and musical practices, adjusting to the acoustics in a unique way. Such a tradition of adaptation must be considered as a part of cultural practice, not to be overlooked during the reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Digital cultural heritage collections in libraries, archives, and museums are increasingly being used for digital humanities research. However, traditional ways of providing access to such collections, for example through digital library interfaces, are less than ideal for researchers who are looking to build datasets around specific research questions. Inspired by the “Collections as Data”Collections as Data movement as an approach for cultural heritage institutions to prepare their digital 1 collections for analysis using digital methods, KBR, the Royal Library of Belgium, has embarked on a 24 month project called DATA-KBR-BE (2020-2022) to facilitate data-level access to its 2 digitised and born-digital collections for digital humanities research.This paper will: a) introduce the concept of “Collections as Data”Collections as Data while exploring the opportunities and challenges for cultural heritage institutions; b) outline the DATA-KBR-BE project and the methodology for piloting “Collections as Data”Collections as Data at KBR; and c) present the preliminary results of initial experiments to extract thematic datasets in support of digital humanities research scenarios as a first step towards designing a sustainable data extraction workflow for KBR.",

    "abstract": "Investigating the intangible nature of a cultural domain can take multiple forms, addressing, for example, the aesthetic, epistemic, and social dimensions of its phenomenology. The context of Southern Chinese martial arts is of particular significance, as it carries immaterial components of all these aspects: The technical and stylistic framework of a martial art system; the imagery associated to movements; and the transmission of knowledge orally, practically, or through influence, are but examples of intangible characteristics that can and should be captured, not unlike cultural artifacts. The latter case—the one of formalizing cultural influence through its various forms of evidenceis emblematic as well as largely untrodden ground. A previous attempt at detecting cultural influence computationally was made in the context of Roman archaeology, though the binding of that early effort with the domain model was tight; also, there has hardly been any prior dedicated effort to model the martial arts domain through ontologies. In this article, we present the realization of the full cycle of a computational approach to investigating cultural contact in Southern Chinese martial arts. The entire approach is predicated upon the usage of standards and techniques of the Semantic Web and formal knowledge. Starting from a modular domain ontology, which models martial arts independently of the goal of capturing cultural influence, we perform knowledge extraction from archival material from the Hong Kong Martial Arts Living Archive and generate a dataset of the results modeled after said ontology. Then, we combine the resulting knowledge base with a rule model that represents ways to infer knowledge of potential contact between cultures based on the evidence present in the knowledge base. The results offer an insight into how an inference-based computational model can be applied to detect interesting facts even in the as-yet underexplored domain of intangible cultural heritage. The implemented workflow shows that the full-cycle employment of semantic technologies can offer the ground truth required for largely different approaches, such as statistical and machine learning ones, to operate.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Despite being an authentic carrier of various cultural practices, the human body is often underutilised to access the knowledge of human body. Digital inventions today have created new avenues to open up cultural data resources, yet mainly as apparatuses for well-annotated and object-based collections. Hence, there is a pressing need for empowering the representation of intangible expressions, particularly embodied knowledge within its cultural context. To address this issue, the authors propose to inspect the potential of machine learning methods to enhance archival knowledge interaction with intangible cultural heritage (ICH) materials. Design/methodology/approach This research adopts a novel approach by combining movement computing with knowledge-specific modelling to support retrieving through embodied cues, which is applied to a multimodal archive documenting the cultural heritage (CH) of Southern Chinese martial arts. Findings Through experimenting with a retrieval engine implemented using the Hong Kong Martial Arts Living Archive (HKMALA) datasets, this work validated the effectiveness of the developed approach in multimodal content retrieval and highlighted the potential for the multimodal’s application in facilitating archival exploration and knowledge discoverability. Originality/value This work takes a knowledge-specific approach to invent an intelligent encoding approach through a deep-learning workflow. This article underlines that the convergence of algorithmic reckoning and content-centred design holds promise for transforming the paradigm of archival interaction, thereby augmenting knowledge transmission via more accessible CH materials.",

    "abstract": "Museums, archives, libraries and other cultural heritage institutes maintain large collections of artefacts, which are valuable knowledge sources for both experts and interested lay persons. Recently, more and more cultural heritage institutes have started to digitise their collections, for instance to make them accessible via web portals. However, while digitisation is a necessary first step towards improved information access, to fully unlock the knowledge contained in these collections, users have to be able to easily browse, search and query these collections. This requires cleaning, linking and enriching the data, a process that is often too time-consuming to be performed manually. Information technology can help with (partially) automating this task. Because data processing and enrichment typically involve the textual metadata level, natural language processing has a key role to play in this endeavour. At the same time, cultural heritage domains pose significant challenges for language technology and call for the development of very robust and flexible solutions. Consequently, cultural heritage data can also serve as a good test-bed for the development of robust natural language processing tools.",

    "abstract": "In today’s academic landscape, network theories are gaining in discursive and operational currency. In his book Prince of Networks: Bruno Latour and Metaphysics, for instance, Graham Harman introduces Latour’s actor-network theory into what Harman calls \"object-oriented philosophy.\" In order to understand the success of recent network theories and to put them into both historical and conceptual perspectives, this essay revisits some network theories avant la lettre. Such an \"archaeology of the future\" is needed because neither Latour nor Harman reference important precursers of network theory, such as Gregory Bateson, Gilles Deleuze, or Michel Serres, in any serious manner. First, the essay describes some of the main characteristics of Latour’s actor-network theory in the light of and against Harman’s argument in Prince of Networks. Second, it shows in what ways the practice of \"nature writing\" could be thought of as a precursor of network theory. Third, it delineates some Deleuzian concepts that might be helpful for future network theories. In its conclusion, this essay argues that ’doing network theory’ implies a number of fundamental changes in the practice of literary and cultural studies, as well as in the practice of the humanities in general.",

The obtained results showed that the number of web archiving initiatives significantly grew after 2003 and they are concentrated on developed countries. We statistically analyzed metrics, such as, the volume of archived data, archive file formats or number of people engaged. Web archives all together must process more data than any web search engine.

    "abstract": "Is culture considered to be our past, our roots, ancient ruins, or an old piece of art? Culture is all the factors that define who we are, how we act and interact in our world, in our daily activities, in our personal and public relations, in our life. Culture is all the things we are not obliged to do. However, today, we live in a mixed environment, an environment that is a combination of “offline” and the online, digital world. In this mixed environment, it is technology that defines our behaviour, technology that unites people in a large world, that finally, defines a status of “monoculture”. In this article, we examine the role of technology, and especially big data, in relation to the culture. We present the advances that led to paradigm shifts in the research area of cultural informatics, and forecast the future of culture as will be defined in this mixed world.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this research is to help clarify how digital and technological transformation can contribute to improving the protection of the cultural heritage of our nation, through the creation of an innovative monitoring system of cultural heritage, where it is possible to faithfully reproduce the study area in a short period of time, analyzing in detail the problems such as the identification of cracks. Firstly, an innovative methodology will be used for the management of a fleet of automated drones for data acquisition, through the use of charging and data transmission bases. The images will allow to produce a 3D model of the study area and subsequently, this large amount of data acquired by drones will be treated with innovative techniques of segmentation and classification of images to visualize the cracks in the buildings present in the study area. Finally, the information will be transmitted to a GIS platform capable of visualizing buildings showing deterioration. This system can be used in both large cities and small towns (or sparsely populated or rural areas). Its versatility makes it capable of weakening territorial inequalities and the possible socio-economic effects that the loss of cultural heritage would entail, such as the crisis in the tourism sector, layoffs and social exclusion. It is important to recognize the relationship between society and technology because it helps us to understand the willingness of many young people to renew, change and improve the world in order to be able to protect the history of cultural and historical heritage.",

    "abstract": "In our Big Data era, data is being generated, collected and analyzed at an unprecedented scale, and data-driven decision making is sweeping through all aspects of society. Recent studies have shown that poor quality data is prevalent in large databases and on the Web. Since poor quality data can have serious consequences on the results of data analyses, the importance of veracity, the fourth “V” of big data is increasingly being recognized. In this tutorial, we highlight the substantial challenges that the first three ‘V’s, volume, velocity and variety, bring to dealing with veracity in big data. Due to the sheer volume and velocity of data, one needs to understand and (possibly) repair erroneous data in a scalable and timely manner. With the variety of data, often from a diversity of sources, data quality rules cannot be specified a priori; one needs to let the “data to speak for itself” in order to discover the semantics of the data. This tutorial presents recent results that are relevant to big data quality management, focusing on the two major dimensions of (i) discovering quality issues from the data itself, and (ii) trading-off accuracy vs efficiency, and identifies a range of open problems for the community.",

Existing definitions of Big Data define Big Data by comparison with existing, usually relational, definitions, or define Big Data in terms of data characteristics or use an approach which combines data characteristics with the Big Data environment. In this paper we examine existing definitions of Big Data and discuss the strengths and limitations of the different approaches, with particular reference to issues related to data quality in Big Data. We identify the issues presented by incomplete or inconsistent definitions. We propose an alternative definition and relate this definition to our work on quality in Big Data.",

    "abstract": "The Web of Data is an increasingly rich source of information, which makes it useful for Big Data analysis. However, there is no guarantee that this Web of Data will provide the consumer with truthful and valuable information. Most research has focused on Big Data’s Volume, Velocity, and Variety dimensions. Unfortunately, Veracity and Value, often regarded as the fourth and fifth dimensions, have been largely overlooked. In this paper we discuss the potential of Linked Data methods to tackle all five V’s, and particularly propose methods for addressing the last two dimensions. We draw parallels between Linked and Big Data methods, and propose the application of existing methods to improve and maintain quality and address Big Data’s veracity challenge.",

    "abstract": "Policy makers produce digital records on a daily basis. A selection of records is then preserved in archival repositories. However, getting access to these archival materials is extremely complicated for many reasons—including data protection, sensitivity, national security, and copyright. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be applied to archives to make them more accessible, but it is still at an experimental stage. While skills gaps contribute to keeping archives “dark”, it is also essential to examine issues of mistrust and miscommunication. This article argues that although civil servants, archivists, and academics have similar professional principles articulated through professional codes of ethics, these are not often communicated to each other. This lack of communication leads to feelings of mistrust between stakeholders. Mistrust of technology also contributes to the barriers to effective implementation of AI tools. Therefore, we propose that surfacing the shared professional ethics between stakeholders can contribute to deeper collaborations between humans. In turn, these collaborations can lead to the building of trust in AI systems and tools. The research is informed by semi-structured interviews with thirty government professionals, archivists, historians, digital humanists, and computer scientists. Previous research has largely focused on preservation of digital records, rather than access to these records, and on archivists rather than records creators such as government professionals. This article is the first to examine the application of AI to digital archives as an issue that requires trust and collaboration across the entire archival circle (from record creators to archivists, and from archivists to users).",

    "abstract": "The processing method based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) amplitude information presented by Cigna et al. (2013, this issue) was used to extract the backscattering coefficient (σ0) from ENVISAT advanced SAR (ASAR) scenes to investigate the archaeological heritage of the Nasca region, southern Peru. Average backscattering and σ0 time series in 2003–2007 were obtained for some of the most famous groups of the Nazca Lines, as well as for the adobe structures of the Ceremonial Centre of Cahuachi, and allowed the recognition of anthropogenic features on arid and bare soil. Despite the expected constraints due to the medium spatial resolution of the ASAR scenes ( 30 m), some features related to the Nasca ancient aqueduct systems (puquios) were detected, and water level changes were inferred from amplitude change detection maps and σ0 time series. The SAR-based prospection results were also compared with a vegetation index derived from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data for 2003, 2004 and 2007. The changes observed over Cahuachi and the neighbouring archaeological mounds are then discussed in light of the recent conservation history of the site and the contemporary archaeological excavations. The research opens interesting perspectives for routine use of SAR data for purposes of archaeological prospection and condition monitoring in (semi-)arid and desert regions.

    "abstract": "This paper provides an overview of the opportunities that image analysts, archaeologists and conservation scientists currently have to use space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery for prospection of cultural landscapes and investigation of environmental, land surface and anthropogenic processes that can alter the condition of heritage assets. The benefits of the recent developments in SAR satellite sensors towards higher resolution (up to less than 1m) and shorter revisiting times (up to a few days) are discussed in relation to established techniques using the two key SAR parameters – amplitude and phase. Selected case studies from Middle East to South America illustrate how SAR can be effectively used to detect subtle archaeological features in modern landscapes, monitor historic sites and assess damage in areas of conflict. These examples form the basis to highlight the current trends in archaeological remote sensing based on space-borne SAR data in the era of the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-1 constellation and on-demand high resolution space missions such as TerraSAR-X.",

    "abstract": "Traditional data in Digital Humanities projects bear various formats (structured, semi-structured, textual) and need substantial transformations (encoding and tagging, stemming, lemmatization, etc.) to be managed and analyzed. To fully master this process, we propose the use of data lakes as a solution to data siloing and big data variety problems. We describe data lake projects we currently run in close collaboration with researchers in humanities and social sciences and discuss the lessons learned running these projects.",

    "abstract": "Digital culture is a mainstay of the emerging 6V era as both the digitization of existing cultural data and the creation of original native digital cultural content directly lead to the generation of large data volumes which may well be bursty, unstructured or semi-structured, and inherently multimodal. One way to address the increased complexity associated with 6V data is to create metadata structures which succinctly summarize a segment of the underlying cultural data, add semantic information, and serve as indexing and clustering points. This conference paper proposes a JSON description for cultural items which is tailored to the needs of the digital culture domain, generic enough to summarize the vast majority of cultural items, and flexible enough to be extended should the need arise. Moreover, it supports by construction multilevel clustering, semantic annotations, and links to and from relevant cultural items. As a concrete example, the proposed description has been imported to an instance of a Neo4j graph database. The latter takes full advantage of the capabilities offered by the proposed JSON metadata structure, especially the dynamic directed linking between similar cultural items. The abovementioned Neo4j is populated with cultural items from the Ionian Islands, a Greek region with rich cultural tradition.",

We will briefly describe the different data models that exist for this purpose and argue their strengths and weaknesses with a special focus on the entification issue, before illustrating this problem with the description of three different ongoing projects. As will be outlined afterwards, it is essential to distinguish at the start of a project between data-driven or user-driven design approaches. As an alternative, the realization of a Linked Data project for bibliographical data might also lead to a hybrid approach were the design process shifts reciprocally between the analysis of the data and the user needs",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, many of our actions are transformed into digital information, which we can use to draw diagrams that describe complex operations, such as those of institutions. This book introduces us to the reading of complex systems through the concept of affinity: the alchemy that brings people together and makes them creative and productive. Affinity’s mapping is a data visualization method that allows us to observe the dynamics of an organization subdivided into complex systems: institutions, universities, governments, etc. It is a graphical tool based on the collaboration variable. Mapping Affinities is, according to the author, an instrument for deciphering complex organizations and improving them. By inserting individuals on these maps, it is also a way of helping them to understand how to evolve in life within an institution. The book tackles this problem with a case study concerning the Federal Polytechnic School of Lausanne. Data from the actions of researchers at the Lausanne institution are brought together and transformed into an innovative and attractive map",

    "abstract": "\"Medieval Manuscripts in the Digital Age explores one major manuscript repository’s digital presence and poses timely questions about studying books from a temporal and spatial distance via the online environment. Through contributions from a large group of distinguished international scholars, the volume assesses the impact of being able to access and interpret these early manuscripts in new ways. The focus on Parker on the Web, a world-class, digital repository of diverse medieval manuscripts, comes as that site made its contents Open Access. Exploring the uses of digital representations of medieval texts and their contexts, contributors consider manuscripts from multiple perspectives including production, materiality, and reception. In addition, the volume explicates new interdisciplinary frameworks of analysis for the study of the relationship between texts and their physical contexts, while centring on an appreciation of the opportunities and challenges effected by the digital representation of a tangible object. Approaches extend from the codicological, palaeographical, linguistic, and cultural to considerations of reader reception, image production, and the implications of new technologies for future discoveries. Medieval Manuscripts in the Digital Age advances the debate in manuscript studies about the role of digital and computational sources and tools. As such, the book will appeal to scholars and students working in the disciplines of Digital Humanities, Medieval Studies, Literary Studies, Library and Information Science, and Book History\"–",

    "abstract": "Our encounter with cultural heritage is changing because of the expansion of digital media. Engagement with heritage, particularly for younger people, is often through digital surrogates, such as virtual reconstructions or digital artifacts. Social interactions at sites and heritage discussions are increasingly transferred to the digital sphere. Apart from this independent and uncoordinated digital activity by communities, there is also a growing exploration of its potential by heritage professionals and organizations. Besides using information technology initially for data capture and the management of collections and sites, numerous cultural institutions are also experimenting with digital media to communicate in new ways and attract new audiences. This is a two-way process: not only have digital technologies influenced heritage management and understanding, but wider heritage interpretation issues have also affected how digital tools are being employed. The chapter examines the potential and range of digital heritage applications, and the challenges and theoretical issues these raise.",

In recent years, significant steps have been taken in the use of augmented reality in promoting and highlighting tangible and intangible cultural heritage around the world, and it is worth looking at the steps which are followed for their creation, how they are assessed by people who used them, and the gaps and shortcomings that appeared. Based on the shortcomings we will be able to better orient ourselves to the kind of digital application that someone who is not so well trained in the field of IT and building complex applications can design. In addition, according to the studies reviewed for this article, there are not many applications that are purely educational in purpose or use serious games, although many recognize that AR technology is refreshing to the learning process, as students of all ages can learn and interact with the app at their own pace.",

    "abstract": "Americans are rapidly adopting innovative technologies which are pushing the frontiers of reality. But when they look at how their privacy is protected within the new extended reality (XR), they will find that U.S. privacy laws fall short. The privacy risks inherent in XR are inadequately addressed by current U.S. data privacy laws or court-created frameworks that purport to protect the constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches. Many scholars, including Ryan Calo, Danielle Citron, Sherry Colb, Margaret Hu, Orin Kerr, Kirsten Martin, Paul Ohm, Daniel Solove, Rebecca Wexler, Shoshana Zuboff, and others, have highlighted the gaps in U.S. privacy protections stemming from big data, artificial intelligence, and increased surveillance technologies. However, the depth and breadth of what XR technology reveals about a person, the risks it poses to bystanders, and the imminent paradigm shift of a public space versus a private space are new problems. This article provides three central contributions to technologists, legislators, and anyone interested in privacy rights: first, a brief guide to understanding XR technology; second, a survey of the current U.S. privacy landscape and the gaps in U.S. privacy protections for XR; and third, an easily digestible list of solutions that legislators and technologists can pursue to better protect privacy in XR.",

    "abstract": "Extended reality (XR) technologies have experienced cycles of development—“summers” and “winters”—for decades, but their overall trajectory is one of increasing uptake. In recent years, immersive extended reality (IXR) applications, a kind of XR that encompasses immersive virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) environments, have become especially prevalent. The European Union (EU) is exploring regulating this type of technology, and this article seeks to support this endeavor. It outlines safety and privacy harms associated with IXR, analyzes to what extent the existing EU framework for digital governance—including the General Data Protection Regulation, Product Safety Legislation, ePrivacy Directive, Digital Markets Act, Digital Services Act, and AI Act—addresses these harms, and offers some recommendations to EU legislators on how to fill regulatory gaps and improve current approaches to the governance of IXR.",

    "abstract": "Linked Data has emerged as the preferred method for publishing and sharing cultural heritage data. One of the main challenges for museums is that the defacto standard ontology (CIDOC CRM) is complex and museums lack expertise in semantic web technologies. In this paper we describe the methodology and tools we used to create 5-star Linked Data for 14 American art museums with a team of 12 computer science students and 30 representatives from the museums who mostly lacked expertise in Semantic Web technologies. The project was completed over a period of 18 months and generated 99 mapping files and 9,357 artist links, producing a total of 2,714 R2RML rules and 9.7M triples. More importantly, the project produced a number of open source tools for generating high-quality linked data and resulted in a set of lessons learned that can be applied in future projects.",

    "abstract": "Taking care of mankind’s cultural heritage is a well-established obligation to us and to our future generations. To that end numerous experts are contributing. Contemporary technological advances, i.e. digital achievements, have helped a lot to this end. In this paper these technological advances are briefly presented and explained. It is attempted to show how these advances may help Cultural heritage if applied correctly and wisely. The argument is not how they will replace traditional documentation or conservation methods, but how they will support, enhance and supplement them for achieving the desired result with sensitivity and knowledge. The available digital documentation techniques are described along with the contemporary non-destructive techniques for cultural heritage pathology diagnosis and conservation. Their advantages are investigated along with their implementation actions. These techniques include image based methodologies for producing three dimensional models of which traditional two-dimensional products may be extracted, laser scanning techniques to acquire directly three-dimensional information from the object, Nondestructive techniques in order to diagnose pathology problems etc. In order to highlight these techniques, several examples are presented. The alternative uses of the contemporary digital techniques are highlighted through these examples. Among others the following applications will be presented: The virtual restoration of a collapsed stone bridge, the virtual restoration of a monument exposed to the weather conditions and the development of a virtual museum are presented. Finally, a future outlook is attempted, in order to envisage the path that the implementation of these technological advances will lead the worldwide effort to document and preserve our cultural heritage.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. “Digital heritage”, as defined in this paper, is the integration of cultural heritage with digitization technology (“cultural heritage + digitization”), and of digital knowledge with research. It includes not only the three conventional aspects of cultural heritage digitization—digital collection and documentation, digital research and information management, digital presentation and interpretation—but also the creation and innovative use/application of the digital content (cultural heritage intellectual property/IP, experiential education, cultural tourism, film and media). Through analysis of two case studies, the Palazzo Valentini in Rome, Italy, and the Old Summer Palace (Yuanmingyuan) in Beijing, China, the paper assesses the concept of “digital heritage” and proposes a conceptual framework to capture recent developments and future prospects with regard to the industry.",

    "abstract": "From the mechanical reproduction outlined by Benjamin to the virtual reality depicted by Baudrillard. With the advent of the information society and the digital age, the dissemination of cultural heritage is gradually moving away from the traditional face-to-face embodied presence toward digital communication that transcends the limits of space and time. Our visual experience has also shifted from the traditional creation and reception of visual images to the invention and immersion in new worlds of spectacle. Virtual reality is a representative new technology in the digital media era, which not only realises the digital simulation of cultural heritage from physical space to cyberspace but also incorporates the characteristics of virtual visual culture into it, freeing heritage sites from the inherent material bulkiness and becoming a lighter, more fluid space, releasing the unlimited possibilities of spectacle simulation. Virtual reality technology has not only reshaped the technology of image viewing and production, but also the technology of image dissemination. Taking cultural heritage sites as an example, this paper will explain the role and impact of virtual technology on the digitisation of cultural heritage and its media dissemination from three aspects: interactivity, spatial perception and cultural value presentation. Based on the analysis above, the involvement of virtual reality in the digitalization of cultural heritage has expanded the types of images in visual culture. Besides pictures, video and scene, it may offer a potential dimension in the quadrants of dynamic and 3D.",

    "abstract": "One of the ongoing challenges for effective utilization of heritage science data is the lack of access to well-organized and accessible extant data sets and the need to structure data in formats that allow interrogation and integration of related data. This need for data fusion expands to both subjective and objective measurements and descriptors, as well as a long-overdue need for established guidelines for metadata and shared terminologies, or more critically, ontologies. Research into this area has shown the need for Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS) that bridge and integrate multiple ontologies that address specific needs &#x2013; for example the Getty Vocabularies for cultural heritage terms, the Linked Art model for a simplified core CIDOC-CRM, as well as the OBO Foundry and other scientific ontologies for measurements and heritage science terminology.[1]",

    "abstract": "3D data production techniques, although increasingly used by archaeologists and Cultural Heritage practitioners, are most often limited to the production of 2D or 3D images. Beyond the modes of visualization of these data, it is necessary to wonder about their possible interactions and uses. Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Mixed Reality, collectively known as eXtended Reality, XR, or Cross Reality, make it possible to envisage natural and/or complex interactions with 3D digital environments. These are physical, tangible, or haptic (i.e., with effort feedback) interactions, which can be understood through different modalities or metaphors, associated with procedures or gestures. These interactions can be integrated by archaeologists in the “operating chain” of an operation (from the ground to the study phase), or be part of a functional reconstitution of the procedures and gestures of the past, in order to help understand an object, a site, or even a human activity. The different case studies presented in this chapter result from collaborations between archaeologists, historians, and computer scientists. They illustrate different interactions in 3D environments, whether they are operational (support for excavation processes) or functional (archaeological objects, human activities of the past).",

    "abstract": "This manuscript identifies and documents unsolved problems and research challenges in the extended reality (XR) domain (i.e., virtual (VR), augmented (AR), and mixed reality (MR)). The manuscript is structured to include technology, design, and human factor perspectives. The text is visualization/display-focused, that is, other modalities such as audio, haptic, smell, and touch, while important for XR, are beyond the scope of this paper. We further narrow our focus to mainly geospatial research, with necessary deviations to other domains where these technologies are widely researched. The main objective of the study is to provide an overview of broader research challenges and directions in XR, especially in spatial sciences. Aside from the research challenges identified based on a comprehensive literature review, we provide case studies with original results from our own studies in each section as examples to demonstrate the relevance of the challenges in the current research. We believe that this paper will be of relevance to anyone who has scientific interest in extended reality, and/or uses these systems in their research.",

    "abstract": "Using past material and spiritual remains, cultural heritage examines communities’ identity formation across time. Cultural heritage requires public and private institutions to care about its restoration, maintenance, conservation, and promotion. Through a bibliometric perspective, this study has analyzed, quantified, and mapped the scientific production of the fourth industrial revolution applied to heritage studies from 2016 to 2021 in the Scopus and Web of Science databases. Biblioshiny software from RStudio was employed to categorize and evaluate the contribution of authors, countries, institutions, and journals. In addition, VOSviewer was used to visualize their collaboration networks. As a main result, we found that augmented reality and remote sensing represent the research hotspot concerning heritage studies. Those techniques have become common in archaeology, as well as museums, leading to an increase in their activity. Perhaps, more recent tools, such as machine learning and deep learning, will provide future pathways in cultural heritage from data collected in social networks. This bibliometric analysis, therefore, provides an updated perspective of the implementations of technologies from industry 4.0 in heritage science as a possible guideline for future worldwide research.",

This book examines this question by exploring a range of advanced imaging technologies, from multispectral to 3D to reflectance transformation imaging. To understand imaging technologies requires an understanding of the complex materiality of what is being digitized and, to this end, the book focuses on the relationship between digital technologies and the complex materiality of manuscripts and the human bodies that engages them. From this perspective, the chapters explore imaging technologies, interfaces to present digital surrogates, and limitations to and enhancements through the digital. But lest past photographic information be lost, the book also examines historical photographs, exploring their rich visual information, and how digitizing and comparing them transforms what can be known. Examples and innovations from the author’s work digitizing the eighth-century St. Chad Gospels at Lichfield Cathedral are provided. This book is essential reading for all those involved in large and small scale manuscript digitization projects in both scholarly and cultural heritage contexts.",

In this paper, we propose the use of Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to automatically generate coherent image galleries that allow intuitive, user-driven exploration of large multimedia collections in virtual reality (VR). We extend the open-source VR museum VIRTUE to support such exhibitions and apply it on different collections using various image features.

    "abstract": "A strange paradox has crept into philological work of all kinds of fields, such as classics, sinology, Islamic studies, medieval studies, and many others. Scholars have been so eager to take advantage of digitized manuscripts, that Wido van Peursen, a biblical scholar, notes: “now that the digital object has become available, who will ever go back to the ‘real’ manuscript?”¹ This in itself may already be a paradox, suggesting that the more our research focusses on the manuscript world, the more our work takes place in the digital world. However, the paradox I have in mind is about what happens",

    "abstract": "Intangible cultural heritage (ICH), made up of all immaterial manifestations of culture, represents the variety of living heritage of humanity as well as the most important vehicle of cultural diversity. The main “constitutive factors” of ICH are represented by the “self-identification” of this heritage as an essential element of the cultural identity of its creators and bearers; by its constant recreation in response to the historical and social evolution of the communities and groups concerned; by its connection with the cultural identity of these communities and groups; by its authenticity; and by its indissoluble relationship with human rights. The international community has recently become conscious that ICH needs and deserves international safeguarding, triggering a legal process which culminated with the adoption in 2003 of the UNESCO Convention on the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage. This Convention correctly highlights the main elements of ICH and is based on the right philosophical rationale, but its operational part – structured on the model provided by the 1972 World Heritage Convention – appears to be inadequate to ensure appropriate safeguarding of the specificities of intangible heritage. This article argues that to correct such inadequacy, international safeguarding of ICH must rely on the concomitant application, even though in an indirect manner, of international human rights law, for the reason that ICH represents a component of cultural human rights and an essential prerequisite to ensure the actual realization and enjoyment of individual and collective rights of its creators and bearers.",

    "abstract": "As a material, glass has been linked with knowledge and skill mastery for at least three millennia, reflecting the use of traditional tools and technologies inherited from the past. The history of glass speaks of know-how, technological transitions, and contaminations among preferences and raw materials. An increase in the awareness of traditional knowledge underlying the tradition of glass manufacturing has recently been observed with the inscription of the art of Venetian glass beads on the UNESCO list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, which has been recognized as a repository of knowledge and mastery of skills, reflecting the use of traditional tools and technologies inherited from the past. However, the potential that glass holds to rediscover the flows and exchanges of technological knowledge in the past has only been explored marginally, and issues linked to the intangible values and the socio-cultural significance of glass are still only sporadically addressed. This review aims to stimulate reflection on the diversity of the significance underlying glass as a material that has marked the cultural and technological history of man. This study will establish the foundation for a methodological reflection in the approach to the study of ancient glass that is intended to help uncover the intangible values that it is an embodiment for.",

    "abstract": "Summary The gender digital divide is a well-known research and policy topic. Policy discourses emphasise the inclusion aspect focusing on equal opportunities and economic empowerment. Critical analyses of the inclusion narrative stress its universalist and normative perspective which implicitly excludes and determines what gender technology inclusion means. This contribution focuses on an alternative perspective developed in Latin America: appropriation of technologies. This approach foregrounds the socio-cultural and economic inequalities present in the Global South. Based on a case study of a transfeminist IT community from Argentina, this paper analyses the transformative aspects of this collective’s imaginary and practices. It argues that this approach is relevant to other Global South contexts where similar communities exist and provides us with a better understanding of possibilities and limits of inclusion in the digital technologies sector. Keywords: gender digital inclusion, appropriation of technologies, imaginaries, practices, IT communities —– Von der digitalen Integration zur IT-Aneignung: vergeschlechtlichte Aspekte von Aneignungsvorstellungen und -praktiken Zusammenfassung Die genderbezogene digitale Spaltung ist ein bekanntes Thema in Forschung und Politik. Politische Diskurse betonen den Inklusionsaspekt, der sich auf Chancengleichheit und wirtschaftliche Stärkung konzentriert. Kritische Analysen des Inklusionsnarrativs betonen dessen universalistische und normative Perspektive, die implizit ausschließt und festlegt, was geschlechterbezogene technologische Inklusion bedeutet. Dieser Beitrag konzentriert sich auf eine alternative, in Lateinamerika entwickelte Perspektive: die Aneignung von Technologien. Dieser Ansatz stellt die soziokulturellen und wirtschaftlichen Ungleichheiten im Globalen Süden in den Vordergrund. Anhand einer Fallstudie über eine transfeministische IT-Gemeinschaft in Argentinien werden die transformativen Aspekte ihrer Aneignungsvorstellungen und -praktiken analysiert. Es wird argumentiert, dass dieser Ansatz auch für andere Kontexte des Globalen Südens, in denen ähnliche Gemeinschaften existieren, relevant ist und uns ein besseres Verständnis der Möglichkeiten und Grenzen der Inklusion im Bereich der digitalen Technologien vermittelt.

    "abstract": "„Die Gleichstellung der Geschlechter zu fördern, ist kluge Entwicklungspolitik“, sagt die Weltbank. Im Einklang damit fördern viele Unternehmen die Geschlechtergleichstellung im Sinne der Überwindung der digitalen Kluft zwischen den Geschlechtern. So werden in Argentinien verschiedene Graswurzelinitiativen von Unternehmen gesponsert, die Schulungen in den Bereichen soziale und digitale Kompetenzen sowie Unternehmertum und Führung anbieten. Ohne die Bemühungen, die Bedeutung und den Wert der Arbeit dieser Gruppen aberkennen zu wollen, untersucht dieser Artikel einige der Widersprüche, die sich daraus ergeben, dass Unternehmen einen zunehmenden Einfluss auf Diskurs und Praxis der Bemühungen um eine Verringerung der geschlechtsspezifischen digitalen Spaltung haben. Meine These ist, dass diese Projekte dazu beitragen, die aktuell bestehenden wirtschaftlichen, sozialen und geografischen Spaltungen zu verstärken, nicht mit klassischen Geschlechterbildern übereinstimmende Menschen zu diskriminieren und die staatlichen Maßnahmen in diesem Bereich weiter einzuschränken.",

    "abstract": "The poster addresses generative design as a methodology for a critical-visual exploration of the 1940s Atlas of Swiss Folklore. When we look at visualizations, we are often intrigued by the idea that they represent naturally existing phenomena through visual form. This poses a challenge to humanities scholars who interpret context-dependent data that represents complex social interweaving that unwind across time and space. The data beneath the Atlas of Swiss Folklore, for example, is the product of a perennial and multilayered process of collection and analysis. This interpretative framework is often no longer comprehensible in the finished visualizations leading to the impression of unambiguous visual statements. But rather than depicting unique meaning, visualizations should invite the viewer to critically question what is being viewed and the circumstances of its creation. The poster presents Generative Design is a promising approach that utilizes morphology and iteration to create a plurality of visualizations. Through Generative Design the Atlas of Swiss Folklore and its circumstances of creation can be examined from different perspectives. Generative Design can be used, for example, to visualize the locations of the atlas data collection in different contexts and thus help evaluate which parts of the population the maps of the atlas are representative or not.",

    "abstract": "Paper publications are no longer the only form of research product. Due to recent initiatives by publication venues and funding institutions, open access datasets and software products are increasingly considered research products and URIs to these products are growing more prevalent in scholarly publications. However, as with all URIs, resources found on the live Web are not permanent. Archivists and institutions including Software Heritage, Internet Archive, and Zenodo are working to preserve data and software products as valuable parts of reproducibility, a cornerstone of scientific research. While some hosting platforms are well-known and can be identified with regular expressions, there are a vast number of smaller, more niche hosting platforms utilized by researchers to host their data and software. If it is not feasible to manually identify all hosting platforms used by researchers, how can we identify URIs to open-access data and software (OADS) to aid in their preservation? We used a hybrid classifier to classify URIs as OADS URIs and non-OADS URIs. We found that URIs to Git hosting platforms (GHPs) including GitHub, GitLab, SourceForge, and Bitbucket accounted for 33% of OADS URIs. Non-GHP OADS URIs are distributed across almost 50,000 unique hostnames. We determined that using a hybrid classifier allows for the identification of OADS URIs in less common hosting platforms which can benefit discoverability for preserving datasets and software products as research products for reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "The idea of Linked Data is to aggregate, harmonize, integrate, enrich, and publish data for re-use on the Web in a cost-efficient way using Semantic Web technologies. We concern two major hindrances for re-using Linked Data: It is often difficult for a re-user to (1) understand the characteristics of the dataset and (2) evaluate the quality the data for the intended purpose. This paper introduces the “Linked Data Finland” platform LDF.fi addressing these issues. We extend the famous 5-star model of Tim Berners-Lee, with the sixth star for providing the dataset with a schema that explains the dataset, and the seventh star for validating the data against the schema. LDF.fi also automates data publishing and provides data curation tools. The first prototype of the platform is available on the web as a service, hosting tens of datasets and supporting several applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Archival research is a complicated task that involves several diverse activities for the extraction of evidence and knowledge from a set of archival documents. The involved activities are usually unconnected, in terms of data connection and flow, making difficult their recursive revision and execution, as well as the inspection of provenance information at data element level. This article proposes a workflow model for holistic data management in archival research: from transcribing and documenting a set of archival documents, to curating the transcribed data, integrating it to a rich semantic network (knowledge graph), and then exploring the integrated data quantitatively. The workflow is provenance-aware, highly recursive and focuses on semantic interoperability, aiming at the production of sustainable data of high value and long-term validity. We provide implementation details for each step of the workflow and present its application in maritime history research. We also discuss relevant quality aspects and lessons learned from its application in a real context.",

    "abstract": "Electronic laboratory notebooks have expanded the utility of the paper laboratory notebook beyond that of a simple record keeping tool. Open electronic laboratory notebooks offer additional benefits to the scientific community including increased transparency, reproducibility, and integrity. A key element underpinning these benefits is facile and expedient knowledge sharing which aids communication and collaboration. In previous projects, we have used LabTrove and LabArchives as open electronic laboratory notebooks, in partnership with GitHub (an open-source web-based platform originally developed for collaborative coding) for communication and discussion. Here we present our personal experiences using GitHub as the central platform for many aspects of the scientific process, including version-controlled recording of experiments, results and interpretation, data storage, project management, workflows, communication, and collaboration. We report on the utility of GitHub as an open electronic laboratory notebook for chemistry research, and discuss our experiences employing it with the Open Source Mycetoma and Open Source Tuberculosis consortia. By outlining its features and shortcomings through their implementation in our work, we demonstrate how using GitHub as a central platform can aid the real-time sharing of knowledge and collaboration, and further democratise scientific research within both open and traditional research models.",

    "abstract": "In 2006 the Imaging and Media Lab at the University of Basel started a first project called Peviar (Permanent Visual Archive) [1, 2]. The aim was to find a digital archival storage solution without the need of periodic migration. The basic approach was to store binary data as 2D barcode on micrographic film. The theoretical, promising results found in Peviar have been further developed. Two subsequent applied science projects concluded in a commercial product called Monolith, which was introduced on the market in 2008.Monolith is a workflow for migration-less preservation of digital data on optical media. It combines the permanence and visual nature of photographic material and the strength of digital imaging technology. The binary information is stored as bit pattern in 2D barcode either on one or multiple film layers. The machine readable code is enriched by human readable metadata in order to describe the archived objects. It also provides detailed descriptions of how to recover the original files. Because of the image based approach, the recovery is not affected by change of technology; digital cameras certainly will be available in the future. Moreover, they will become better and cheaper.",

    "abstract": "On the technical level, the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) offers a common standard for referring to images or parts of images using a well-defined URL-based syntax. This allows transformations like scaling, rotation, mirroring, and format conversions to be applied. However, for the full integration of digital objects in other environments, interoperability has to go beyond mere technical specifications for access. Nontechnical metadata such as image descriptions, annotations, and references to other objects (e.g., texts, transcriptions, and other visual representations) must be available as well. Using the example of digital facsimiles of the scientific notebook of Jacob I Bernoulli and its transcriptions, we show how XML together with the IIIF Image API allows for a seamless integration and merging of image and text sources in the same environment.",

    "abstract": "Data Provenance refers to the \"origin\", \"lineage\", and \"source\" of data. In this work, we examine provenance from a semantics perspective and present the W7 model, an ontological model of data provenance. In the W7 model, provenance is conceptualized as a combination of seven interconnected elements including \"what\", \"when\", \"where\", \"how\", \"who\", \"which\" and \"why\". Each of these components may be used to track events that affect data during its lifetime. The W7 model is general and extensible enough to capture provenance semantics for data in different domains. Using the example of the Wikipedia, we illustrate how the W7 model can capture domain or application specific provenance.",

    "abstract": "Arabic translation  Spanish translation  French translation Since the Santa Barbara Statement on Collections as Data (2017) was published, engagement with collections-as-data has grown internationally. Institutions large and small, individually and collectively, have invested in developing, providing access to, and supporting responsible computational use of collections as data. An updated statement was needed in light of increased community implementation of collections as data in context of an ever more complex data landscape.  The Vancouver Statement suggests a set of principles for thinking through questions that collections-as-data work produces, as part of an expanding global, interprofessional, and interdisciplinary effort to empower memory, knowledge, and data stewards (e.g., practitioners and scholars) who aim to support responsible development and computational use of collections as data. This stewardship role only grows in importance as artificial intelligence applications, trained on vast amounts of data, including collections as data, impact our lives ever more pervasively. The Vancouver Statement is the product of diverse contributions from the participants of the working event, Collections as Data: State of the Field and Future Directions, held April 25-26, 2023 at Internet Archive Canada in addition to asynchronous community feedback. Professional translation of the Vancouver Statement was provided by Transolution. Special thanks go to Gimena del Rio Riande and Gaëlle Béquet for additional review of statement translations.",

    "abstract": "Purpose This article describes the interviews the authors conducted in late 2021 with 19 researchers at the Department of Classical Philology and Italian Studies at the University of Bologna. The main purpose was to shed light on the definition of the word “data” in the humanities domain, as far as FAIR data management practices are concerned, and on what researchers think of the term. Design/methodology/approach The authors invited one researcher for each of the official disciplinary areas represented within the department and all 19 accepted to participate in the study. Participants were then divided into five main research areas: philology and literary criticism, language and linguistics, history of art, computer science and archival studies. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using a grounded theory approach. Findings A list of 13 research data types has been compiled thanks to the information collected from participants. The term “data” does not emerge as especially problematic, although a good deal of confusion remains. Looking at current research management practices, methodologies and teamwork appear more central than previously reported. Originality/value Our findings confirm that “data” within the FAIR framework should include all types of inputs and outputs humanities research work with, including publications. Also, the participants of this study appear ready for a discussion around making their research data FAIR: they do not find the terminology particularly problematic, while they rely on precise and recognised methodologies, as well as on sharing and collaboration with colleagues.",

    "abstract": "Abstract GLAM institutions have continuously digitised their analogue material since the beginning of the 21st century. Also, the number of digital repositories has grown, and the pressure for open or FAIR data has increased. However, most digital assets need more visibility and usage. This is particularly problematic because storage and continuous migration are cumbersome and expensive tasks. To improve this situation, we design a participatory web platform with tools to make annotating, contextualising, and organising images and their meta information easier. The project &#x201C;Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives&#x201D; is developed in cooperation with the photo archives of the Swiss Folklore Society (SSFS, Basel, Switzerland). The Swiss National Science Foundation funds it from 2021 to 2025, and here, we present an intermediate project status. The interdisciplinary research team consists of scholars from the Bern Academy of the Arts, the Cultural Studies and European Ethnology, and the Digital Humanities Lab of the University of Basel. The PIA team (Participatory Image Archives) aims to make the platform available to researchers and the general public to conduct Citizen Science research.",

    "abstract": "This thesis is about research communication in the context of the Web. I analyse literature which reveals how researchers are making use of Web technologies for knowledge dissemination, as well as how individuals are disempowered by the centralisation of certain systems, such as academic publishing platforms and social media. I share my findings on the feasibility of a decentralised and interoperable information space where researchers can control their identifiers whilst fulfilling the core functions of scientific communication: registration, awareness, certification, and archiving.<br /> The contemporary research communication paradigm operates under a diverse set of sociotechnical constraints, which influence how units of research information and personal data are created and exchanged. Economic forces and non-interoperable system designs mean that researcher identifiers and research contributions are largely shaped and controlled by third-party entities; participation requires the use of proprietary systems.<br /> From a technical standpoint, this thesis takes a deep look at semantic structure of research artifacts, and how they can be stored, linked and shared in a way that is controlled by individual researchers, or delegated to trusted parties. Further, I find that the ecosystem was lacking a technical Web standard able to fulfill the awareness function of research communication. Thus, I contribute a new communication protocol, Linked Data Notifications (published as a W3C Recommendation) which enables decentralised notifications on the Web, and provide implementations pertinent to the academic publishing use case. So far we have seen decentralised notifications applied in research dissemination or collaboration scenarios, as well as for archival activities and scientific experiments.<br /> Another core contribution of this work is a Web standards-based implementation of a clientside tool, dokieli, for decentralised article publishing, annotations and social interactions. dokieli can be used to fulfill the scholarly functions of registration, awareness, certification, and archiving, all in a decentralised manner, returning control of research contributions and discourse to individual researchers.<br /> The overarching conclusion of the thesis is that Web technologies can be used to create a fully functioning ecosystem for research communication. Using the framework of Web architecture, and loosely coupling the four functions, an accessible and inclusive ecosystem can be realised whereby users are able to use and switch between interoperable applications without interfering with existing data.<br /> Technical solutions alone do not suffice of course, so this thesis also takes into account the need for a change in the traditional mode of thinking amongst scholars, and presents the Linked Research initiative as an ongoing effort toward researcher autonomy in a social system, and universal access to human- and machine-readable information. Outcomes of this outreach work so far include an increase in the number of individuals self-hosting their research artifacts, workshops publishing accessible proceedings on the Web, in-the-wild experiments with open and public peer-review, and semantic graphs of contributions to conference proceedings and journals (the Linked Open Research Cloud).<br /> Some of the future challenges include: addressing the social implications of decentralised Web publishing, as well as the design of ethically grounded interoperable mechanisms; cultivating privacy aware information spaces; personal or community-controlled on-demand archiving services; and further design of decentralised applications that are aware of the core functions of scientific communication.",

    "abstract": "The CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model is a well-known conceptual modelling language for documenting cultural heritage artefacts, with a special attention to museum objects. CRM is an ISO standard since 2006 (ISO21127:2006) and renewed 2014 (ISO21127:2014). The CRM is specified in a semantic data modelling style and relies on consolidated notions for the representation of knowledge such as classes, properties, IsA hierarchies, domain and range constraints and cardinality restrictions. However, the CRM still lacks a formal specification of its semantical and inferential apparatus. This lack makes it difficult to clearly define fundamental operations on a CRM knowledge base, such as querying or consistency checking, while preventing any investigation on the computational properties of the language. This paper provides such an apparatus by expressing the CRM as a first-order theory. It then provides a reduction of the theory to a datalog program, and shows how the program can be used to effectively query a knowledge base taking into account the logical consequences of the represented knowledge.",

    "abstract": "This chapter examines the poetics and politics of the “digital” historical object, and offers a different interpretation of the relationship between virtual and material objects and more abstract concepts of materiality, authority, interpretation, aura and authenticity, representation, affect, knowledge, experience, and value. It looks at prevailing debates and bifurcations used to describe and define historical collections and virtual/digital “historical” objects, and shows how an object-centered museum culture and material culture paradigms have bounded digital historical collections. The chapter argues that the roles and uses of the digital object must be understood as part of the broader heritage complex—an institutionalized culture of practices and ideas which is inherently political in nature, socially and culturally circumscribed. It also rejects the formalist notions of materiality and technology that make digital objects fit into the specific rubric of “replicant,” and which have constrained their value, meaning, and imaginative uses.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale digitization in Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAM) created the conditions for providing access to collections as data. It opened new opportunities to explore, use and reuse digital collections. Strong proponents of collections as data are the Innovation Labs which provided numerous examples of publishing datasets under open licenses in order to reuse digital content in novel and creative ways. Within the current transition to the emerging data spaces, clouds for cultural heritage and open science, the need to identify practices which support more GLAM institutions to offer datasets becomes a priority, especially within the smaller and medium-sized institutions. This paper answers the need to support GLAM institutions in facilitating the transition into publishing their digital content and to introduce collections as data services; this will also help their future efficient contribution to data spaces and cultural heritage clouds. It offers a checklist that can be used for both creating and evaluating digital collections suitable for computational use. The main contributions of this paper are i) a methodology for devising a checklist to create and assess digital collections for computational use; ii) a checklist to create and assess digital collections suitable for use with computational methods; iii) the assessment of the checklist against the practice of institutions innovating in the Collections as data field; and iv) the results obtained after the application and recommendations for the use of the checklist in GLAM institutions.",

With a view to tailoring a solution to fit the end user’s needs, the dissemination copies of video material could be automatically converted on demand from their master files. Such a reduced data structure simplifies access to digital video sources but leads as well to simplified preservation due to reduced data volume and data complexity. Dissemination copies do not require specific dispositions for digital archiving anymore.Memory institutions would greatly benefit from a technology that can be integrated into a Web-based infrastructure. In such a way video content can for example be embedded into flexible Virtual Research Environments which allow scholars to work and cite more accurately video resources using IIIF.",

    "abstract": "The circular bioeconomy is a highly scrutinized concept in Finland and internationally, with a high degree of polarization regarding forest utilization rates and distrust between certain actors. This offers an interesting case for an exploratory analysis of issues associated with knowledge co-production. Knowledge co-production entails the integration of different knowledge types and collaboration across multiple societal actors with potentially conflicting viewpoints and agendas. We interviewed key organizations operating at the nexus of science and policy in the processes of knowledge co-production regarding the circular bioeconomy in Finland, including representatives from ministries, universities, research institutes, innovation promoters, and interest organizations. Using qualitative content analysis, we assessed the actors’ tacit knowledge and perceptions regarding 1) their role in knowledge co-production across knowledge types; 2) elements enabling knowledge co-production; and 3) tensions and needs/opportunities of knowledge co-production. To frame our data collection and analysis, we particularly draw from recent sustainability science literature on knowledge types in co-production. The findings reveal that the three main knowledge types – lay, expert, and scientific – are acknowledged by all actors, but are dealt with, to different extents, according to the roles played by different actors in the process of knowledge generation. Collaboration was reported to be largely project-oriented, enabled by funding, similar mindsets, and organizational/individual networks. Tensions included conflicting ideological positions held by various actors in the circular bioeconomy, mainly hampering the co-production of normative/target knowledge; funding-induced gaps and risks in inter-actor cooperation, mainly affecting process/system knowledge of the circular bioeconomy; and gaps and difficulties in cross-sectoral and cross-discipline engagement, mainly affecting predictive/transformative knowledge. Knowledge synthesis, policy-supporting knowledge, and transformative knowledge were perceived by several interviewees to be important avenues towards improving the sustainability potential of the Finnish forest sector. This research paper explores the role of citizen and community engagement in climate mitigation projects, particularly related to climate infrastructure development in the Irish context. A change is needed with relation to the way in which institutions interact with community groups and citizens in order to effectively go about implementing the necessary measures to expedite the transition to a low-carbon energy system. Within this research we implement a co-production approach to the investigation of community engagement practices within public bodies, moving from framings centred on social acceptance towards social acceptability. The 2020 OECD report stressed the importance of co-production in transdisciplinary approaches to sustainable development, climate action and the Sustainable Development Goals. We develop a range of good practice guidelines for community engagement that seek to connect, build and improve current mitigation measures and on from this suggest policy measures for their implementation. The paper sets the foundations for developing a co-production framework for climate related infrastructure developments between citizens, communities and public bodies. Co-production is one of the most important ideas in the theory and practice of knowledge and governance for global sustainability, including ecology and biodiversity conservation. A core challenge confronting the application of co-production has been confusion over differences in definition and practice across several disciplinary traditions, including sustainability science, public administration, and science and technology studies. In this paper, we review the theoretical foundations of these disciplinary traditions and how each has applied co-production. We suggest, at the theoretical level, the differences across disciplines are, in fact, more apparent than real. We identify several theoretical convergences that allow us to synthesize a strong conceptual foundation for those seeking to design and implement co-production work in programs of global sustainability research and policy. The phenomenologist Renaud Barbaras defends an alternative conception of life against the well-known proposals that view life as self-preserving or seeking to replicate its own means of replication in the form of repetition instead of creation or accomplishment as Barbaras proposes. Indeed, he criticizes the reductive nature of scientific inquiry which tries to define life solely on the basis of the internal constraints, which leads to an impossible true biology. Barbaras’ conception is rooted in Husserl and Merleau-Ponty who conceives perception as a subjective act by which the subject enters a relationship with the world. This leads the subject to overcome the Husserlian resources to reach the originary link of the organism with itself and the exteriority. This originary link is expressed in the ambiguity of the verb “to live” in French which designates both being alive and the experience of something. According to Barbaras, desire as life is the infinite exploration of the external world. The movement is due to the nature of perception itself, inasmuch as infinite exploration is in the very nature of the perceptive movement itself, which opens an unfulfillable absence within the exterior world. Then, life as desire is the desire of the world. Life is accomplished only as an unfolding of the world. Then, Barbaras’ model seems to preserve the unity of the organism that allows the phenomenal level or the lived experience, the indefinite engagement with exteriority and the positivity of absence created by the movement through its activity. From this, we propose to complement Barbaras’ insights on negativity and the expressions of desire with our approach concerning three main points. In the first place, we interpret Barbaras’ notion of life as accomplishment within the Whiteheadian framework of creativity, thereby granting the thermodynamic reality of living systems. Secondly, we clarify the meaning of the couple movement/manifestation so that these concepts are as fully applicable to the plant world as Barbaras accords to the animal world. Finally, our theoretical approach uses category theory to give scalability to the model. Children’s geographies, or more correctly the geographies of children and young people, explore the relationship between children, young people, and space. Space matters as it impacts directly on the ways children interact with society and on their physical and mental well-being. It is also an important determinant of their life chances. Children’s geographies is increasingly recognized as a significant focus of geographical research, especially in relation to the lives of children in the majority world. Children’s lives are being directly affected by the changing global environment. Children’s geographies has much to offer in understanding and responding to these changes. The impact of stroke is devastating the life of patients, families, and even the communities. The cost of treatment; however, has the tendency of increasing nowadays, which has brought a heavy burden to patients and their families. Our study aims to collect the data of the hospital cost among stroke patients in Chinese island populations over the past decade and provide the scientific improvement for stroke. We retrospectively collected the basic information and hospital costs of the stroke patients in Dalian Changhai Hospital from 2003 to 2013 using the Information Registration System of Inpatient. The total cumulative hospital admissions for stroke in Dalian Changhai Hospital were 1367 and showed a rising tendency from 2003 to 2013. Our results illustrated that the annual cumulative hospital costs of stroke inpatients increased rapidly in the past 11 years (the average rise was 37.71% per year), and the mean hospital cost per admission was 1.66% higher than that before, when the mean length of hospital days showed a downward tendency. Medication cost was found to be the largest part in the overall hospital cost (as a high percentage of 73.94%); however, traditional Chinese medicine only occupied quite a small proportion in the medicines. The hospital cost for stroke in Dalian Changhai County has brought an increasingly heavy economic burden to the local government and residents.",

    "abstract": "Inclusion has emerged as an early cornerstone value for the emerging domain of “data ethics.” On the surface, appeals to inclusion appear to address the threat that biased data technologies making decisions or misrepresenting people in ways that reproduce longer standing patterns of oppression and violence. Far from a panacea for the threats of pervasive data collection and surveillance, however, these emerging discourses of inclusion merit critical consideration. Here, I use the lens of discursive violence to better theorize the relationship between inclusion and the violent potentials of data science and technology. In doing so, I aim to articulate the problematic and often perverse power relationships implicit in ideals of “inclusion” broadly, which—if not accompanied by dramatic upheavals in existing hierarchical power structures—too often work to diffuse the radical potential of difference and normalize otherwise oppressive structural conditions.",

    "abstract": "The Body Multiple is an extraordinary ethnography of an ordinary disease. Drawing on fieldwork in a Dutch university hospital, Annemarie Mol looks at the day-to-day diagnosis and treatment of atherosclerosis. A patient information leaflet might describe atherosclerosis as the gradual obstruction of the arteries, but in hospital practice this one medical condition appears to be many other things. From one moment, place, apparatus, specialty, or treatment, to the next, a slightly different “atherosclerosis” is being discussed, measured, observed, or stripped away. This multiplicity does not imply fragmentation; instead, the disease is made to cohere through a range of tactics including transporting forms and files, making images, holding case conferences, and conducting doctor-patient conversations.The Body Multiple juxtaposes two distinct texts. Alongside Mol’s analysis of her ethnographic material—interviews with doctors and patients and observations of medical examinations, consultations, and operations—runs a parallel text in which she reflects on the relevant literature. Mol draws on medical anthropology, sociology, feminist theory, philosophy, and science and technology studies to reframe such issues as the disease-illness distinction, subject-object relations, boundaries, difference, situatedness, and ontology. In dialogue with one another, Mol’s two texts meditate on the multiplicity of reality-in-practice.Presenting philosophical reflections on the body and medical practice through vivid storytelling, The Body Multiple will be important to those in medical anthropology, philosophy, and the social study of science, technology, and medicine.",

    "abstract": "En este artículo, nos proponemos anali­zar y discutir en torno a algunas cuestiones que nos permitan comprender las repercusiones que tienen los dispositivos tecnológicos digitales, particularmen­te las referidas a la idea de apropiación. Por lo general, esta noción ha sido asociada a las prácticas de uso que los sujetos despliegan a partir de su vínculo con las tecnologías. Desde hace varios años venimos insistiendo en la necesidad de construir nuevas herramientas teó­rico-metodológicas para estudiar estos fenómenos, también novedosos, que nos permitan el diseño de una matriz o paradigma de análisis. Sin embargo, a me­dida que hemos avanzado en nuestras investigaciones sobre la temática, adver­timos que existe una diferencia, sustancial aunque no haya sido identificada antes, entre las prácticas de apropiación de tecnologías, por un lado, y el paradigma de la apropiación de tecnologías, por otro.",

El objetivo se dirige a desarrollar una lectura que sitúa en un mismo plano cuerpo y tecnología para interpretar los feminismos como prácticas hacker a sistemas normativos. Dicha lectura es derivada de las reflexiones propiciadas por la experiencia etnográfica con colectivos, trayectorias y proyectos que abordan la conexión entre cuerpos, sexualidades y tecnologías desde perspectivas feministas y transfeministas.",

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes the initial phases of a large-scale custom software effort, the Worm Community System (WCS), a collaborative system designed for a geographically dispersed community of geneticists. Despite high user satisfaction with the system and interface, and extensive user feedback and analysis, many users experienced difficulties in signing on and use, ranging from simple lack of resources to complex organizational and intellectual trade-offs. Using Bateson’s levels of learning, we characterize these as levels of infrastructural complexity which challenge both users and developers. Usage problems may result from different perceptions of this complexity in different organizational contexts.",

    "abstract": "There is a deep distrust of experts in America today. Influenced by populist politics, many question or downright ignore the recommendations of scientists, scholars, and others with specialized training. It appears that expertise, a critical component of democratic life, no longer appeals to wide swaths of the body politic. On Expertise is a robust defense of the expert class. Ashley Rose Mehlenbacher examines modern and ancient theories of expertise through the lens of rhetoric and interviews some forty professionals, revealing how they understand their own expertise and how they came to be known as “experts.” She shows that expertise requires not only knowledge and skill but also, crucially, an acknowledgment by others—both specialists and laypeople—that one is a credible authority. At its heart, expertise is a rhetorical construct, and to be persuasive, experts must have the ability to apply their knowledge and skills rightly—in the right way, at the right time, to achieve the right end. Ultimately, Mehlenbacher argues that experts apply their technical knowledge effectively and win others’ trust through acting prudently and cultivating goodwill. Timely, practical, and sophisticated, On Expertise provides vital scaffolding for our understanding of expertise and its real-world application. This book is essential for beginning the work of rehabilitating the expert class amid a politics of extreme populism and anti-intellectualism.",

    "abstract": "Co-creation, a form of engagement in which stakeholders jointly generate value, has increasingly received attention as a way to enhance responsible research and innovation (RRI). To explore the extent to which co-creation might support RRI, this paper analyses three co-creation workshops with different types of stakeholders in the area of nanotechnology for health. The analysis considers the potential of co-creation to enhance the legitimacy of and add value to innovation based on the four dimensions of RRI: reflexivity, inclusion, anticipation, and adaptation. The results show that it is difficult to address all the dimensions at once. A trade-off between creating legitimacy and added value can be detected: a co-creation process focusing on added value requires deliberation early in the innovation process, a certain specificity and an action-oriented perspective. This comes at the cost of the inclusion and anticipation of societal values, which are important dimensions of a legitimate innovation process.",

HTJ2K promises faster encoding and decoding speeds compared to traditional JPEG2000 Part-1, while requiring little or no changes to existing code and infrastructure. The IIIF community has completed a project to evaluate HTJ2K as a drop-in replacement for encoding JPEG2000 and to validate the expected improvements regarding speed and efficiency., The group looked at a number of tools including Kakadu, OpenJPEG, and Grok that support HTJ2K and ran encoding tests comparing the encoding speeds and required disk space for these images. The group also set up decoding speed tests comparing HTJ2K with tiled pyramid TIFF and traditional JPEG2000 using one of the major open source IIIF Image servers, IIPImage. , We found that HTJ2K is significantly faster than traditional JPEG2000, though the results are more nuanced when compared with TIFF.",

    "abstract": "What could be a common point among getting information about a concert, transferring money from one’s bank account, publishing a genomics database, communicating with one’s children on the other side of the planet, and accessing information about one’s car ? The fact that they can all be done through the Web. It is indeed difficult to think of a human activity that hasn’t been impacted by the Web, and as I write this article in April 2017, the current estimate is that the Web has more than 3 billion direct users throughout the world. In the same month, the British computer scientist Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee was awarded the 2016 Turing prize for having invented the World Wide Web, the first Web browser, and the protocols and algorithms that enabled the passage to the scale of the Web. Sir Tim, as he is called, is a professor at MIT and at Oxford University. This prize is just the latest of a long list of distinctions that he has received. But the Turing prize is considered the Nobel prize of computer science, and this award has been widely expected for his invention of the Web, an invention which has transformed our society since its creation in 1989. This is thus a good occasion to revisit, in this article, the history of his invention, and at the same time try to highlight many of the influences and currents that interacted to bring it about. This will also be an occasion, for us, to deconstruct certain notions and to reintegrate others, in an effort to tie together the numerous influences that weaved the web.",

    "abstract": "Le numérique reconfigure l’organisation et le statut des archives. Plongées dans l’éternel présent de leur jouvence technologique nécessaire à leur consultation, les archives numériques ne portent potentiellement plus les marques du temps alors qu’elles montrent le passé. Elles en gagnent une appétence nouvelle, se fondant dans les usages communicationnels du moment. Mais comment alors leur donner leur sens d’archive, leur restituer leur temporalité propre ? L’enjeu est de permettre ce que nous appelons « l’empathie historique » sans tomber pour autant dans l’anachronisme psychologique. Nous argumentons ici que la médiatisation des archives audiovisuelles numériques doit permettre se sentir concerné, avec les concessions sans doute nécessaires à la technologie et l’esthétisme du moment, tout en percevant l’étrangeté des contenus et l’aspect définitivement révolu de ce passé. C’est donc une herméneutique critique particulière à construire, où la médiation doit montrer un passé que la technologie affiche dans une contemporanéité permanente et persistante.",

    "abstract": "There are strong links between heritage and the environment yet, heritage is not fully included in existing ecosystem-based frameworks. Different understandings of heritage values exist, and heritage values are not yet related to key value categories in environmental values research. To address this gap and facilitate a common values-based approach, we develop a novel framework that links heritage and environmental values. First, we expand the understanding of heritage values by linking heritage to key environmental value categories. We then use the Life Framework of Values to show how heritage features in the different ways in which people relate to the world. The resulting heritage values framework is operationalised by applying it to six case examples drawn from participatory research on the governance of European coastal and maritime heritage. We found that the environment was not only considered to be a setting for heritage but was itself valued as heritage in different ways; that heritage is not extrinsic to the environment but is also a way in which people see meaning in the environment; and that multiple value frames and types were involved in shaping this perspective. The results highlight important discrepancies between stakeholders’ perspectives and existing management approaches. Applying the framework shows the ways in which heritage and nature are entwined by providing a structure for elucidating what can be valued as heritage, what values can inform heritage values and how heritage values feature in human–nature relations.

    "abstract": "Despite the increasing number of three-dimensional (3D) model portals and online repositories catering for digital heritage scholars, students and interested members of the general public, there are very few recent academic publications that offer a critical analysis when reviewing the relative potential of these portals and online repositories. Solid reviews of the features and functions they offer are insufficient; there is also a lack of explanations as to how these assets and their related functionality can further the digital heritage (and virtual heritage) field, and help in the preservation, maintenance, and promotion of real-world 3D heritage sites and assets. What features do they offer? How could their feature list better cater for the needs of the GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives and museums) sector? This article’s priority is to examine the useful features of 8 institutional and 11 commercial repositories designed specifically to host 3D digital models. The available features of their associated 3D viewers, where applicable, are also analysed, connecting recommendations for future-proofing with the need to address current gaps and weaknesses in the scholarly field of 3D digital heritage. Many projects do not address the requirements stipulated by charters, such as access, reusability, and preservation. The lack of preservation strategies and examples highlights the oxymoronic nature of virtual heritage (oxymoronic in the sense that the virtual heritage projects themselves are seldom preserved). To study these concerns, six criteria for gauging the usefulness of the 3D repositories to host 3D digital models and related digital assets are suggested. The authors also provide 13 features that would be useful additions for their 3D viewers.Highlights:A survey of relevant features from eight institutional and eleven commercial online 3D repositories in the scholarly fieldof 3D digital heritage.Presents a critical review of their hosting services and 3D model viewer features.Proposes six features to enhance services of 3D repositories to support the GLAM sector, heritage scholars andheritage communities.",

    "abstract": "“Europeana.eu” is Europe’s digital library, archive and museum portal. The European Commission funded its development as part of a digital libraries initiative to integrate access to Europe’s distributed digitised cultural heritage resources. The prototype of “Europeana.eu” was launched by the President of the European Commission in November 2008 to such large-scale public interest that the portal came to a standstill. Now back online with full functionality, it gives access to 4.5 million items from over 1 000 of Europe’s major libraries, museums, galleries, archives and audio-visual collections. The case study describes both the political and practical development of Europeana. It covers the user research and testing behind Europeana, and its metadata elements and surrogate model. It concludes with a description of the projects which will be contributing content and technology solutions to Europeana over the next two years, to bring it to fully operational service. The next version will be launched in summer 2010 with access to over 10 million digital items.   „Europeana eu“ ist Europas digitales Bibliotheks-, Archiv- und Museumsportal. Die Europäische Kommission finanzierte seine Entwicklung als Teil einer digitalen Bibliotheksinitiative, um den Zugang zu Europas verteilten digitalen Kulturerbe-Quellen zusammenzuführen. Der Prototyp von „Europeana eu“ wurde im November 2008 vom Präsidenten der Europäischen Kommission eröffnet und erhielt solch riesiges öffentliches Interesse, dass das Portal zum Stillstand kam. Jetzt ist es wieder online mit allen Funktionalitäten; es gibt Zugang zu 4.5 Millionen Objekten aus über 1 000 der größten Bibliotheken, Museen, Galerien, Archive und audiovisuellen Sammlungen Europas. Der Beitrag beschreibt sowohl die politische als auch die praktische Entwicklung von Europeana. Er behandelt die Anwenderuntersuchung und Tests hinter Europeana, die Metadatenelemente und das Ersatzmodell. Er schließt mit einer Beschreibung der Projekte, die während der nächsten zwei Jahre Inhalts- und Technologielösungen für Europeana beisteuern werden, um es zu einem vollständig einsatzfähigen Dienst zu machen. Die nächste Version wird im Sommer 2010 eröffnet und Zugang zu über 10 Millionen digitalen Objekten bieten.   «Europeana.eu» est le portail numérique de bibliothèques, archives et de musées de l’Europe.

Le prototype d’ »Europeana.eu» fut inauguré par le président de la Commission européenne en novembre 2008 et connut un tel intérêt public énorme que le portail vint à l’arrêt. Maintenant il est de nouveau en ligne avec toutes les fonctionnalités; il donne accès à 4.5 millions d’objets de plus de 1 000 des plus grandes bibliothèques, musées, galeries, archives et collections audio-visuelles d’Europe.",

    "abstract": "Three resources have been developed over the ages to deal with agency. The first one is to attribute to them naturality, and to link them with nature. The second one is to grant them sociality, and to tie them to the social fabric. The third one is to consider them as a semiotic construction, and to relate agency with building of meaning. The originality of science studies comes from the impossibility of clearly differentiating between these three resources. Microbes, neutrinos of DNA are at the same time natural, social and discourse. They are real, human and semiotic entities in the same breath. The article explores the consequences of this peculiar situation which has not been underlined before science studies forced us to retie the links between these three resources. The actor-network theory as developed by Callon and his colleagues is an attempt to invent a vocabulary to deal with this new situation. The article reviews those difficulties and tries to overcome them by showing how they may be used to account for the construction of entities, that is for the attribution of nature, society and meaning.",

This paper identifies some of the key problems related to site preservation and the use of built structures, as well as an assessment of selected examples of both shelters and enclosures. From these examples a range of problems, from practical to aesthetic, are identified. The need to establish guidelines and planning procedures for design and implementation for future projects is highlighted and suggestions for future study and design modification are given.",

    "abstract": "Concerns about secondary use of data and limited opportunities for benefit-sharing have focused attention on the tension that Indigenous communities feel between (1) protecting Indigenous rights and interests in Indigenous data (including traditional knowledges) and (2) supporting open data, machine learning, broad data sharing, and big data initiatives. The International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group (within the Research Data Alliance) is a network of nation-state based Indigenous data sovereignty networks and individuals that developed the “CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance” (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics) in consultation with Indigenous Peoples, scholars, non-profit organizations, and governments. The CARE Principles are people– and purpose-oriented, reflecting the crucial role of data in advancing innovation, governance, and self-determination among Indigenous Peoples. The Principles complement the existing data-centric approach represented in the “FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship” (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). The CARE Principles build upon earlier work by the Te Mana Raraunga Maori Data Sovereignty Network, US Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network, Maiam nayri Wingara Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Data Sovereignty Collective, and numerous Indigenous Peoples, nations, and communities. The goal is that stewards and other users of Indigenous data will “Be FAIR and CARE.” In this first formal publication of the CARE Principles, we articulate their rationale, describe their relation to the FAIR Principles, and present examples of their application.",

    "abstract": "Advances in technology and digital access have improved utilization and interpretation of scientific analyses for cultural heritage and humanities studies. Integrating scientific and curatorial knowledge (STEM to STEAM) is a critical multidisciplinary approach. Researchers have exposed previously unknown contextual information within original materials, such as changing “subjects to citizens”subjects to citizens on the Rough Draft of the Declaration of Independence. Using hyperspectral imaging, researchers provide new data layers by capturing images of documents in distinct wavebands of the visible and non-visible spectrum. Spectral imaging at the Library of Congress also allows integration of data from other non-invasive analytical techniques to map objects analytically.Digital imaging capabilities allow researchers to characterize pigments and inks on the object, retrieve lost text, and illuminate creation methods. Captured data provides access to information from fragile historic documents, including the 1507 Waldseemüller World Map and 1513 Ptolemy Geographia. Investigations revealed links to the same printing location. “Scriptospatial”Scriptospatial refers to a global information system approach for documents, creating an interactive interface for scholars and scientists to engage with object data. Viewing digital cultural materials in multiple dimensions applies an archaeological approach, uncovering and interconnecting information strata of unique documents. Utilizing an object-oriented approach in conjunction with the data layer allows mapping of spatial and temporal data with increasing complexity for direct sharing and visualization of data. This scriptospatial concept enhances the ability to support cross-disciplinary research collaborations and analyses. These relationships support valuable and innovative creative approaches to data integration, while strengthening effective art and scientific collaborations.",

    "abstract": "Cultural content on the Web is available in various domains (cultural objects, datasets, geospatial data, moving images, scholarly texts and visual resources), concerns various topics, is written in different languages, targeted to both laymen and experts, and provided by different communities (libraries, archives museums and information industry) and individuals (Figure 1). The integration of information technologies and cultural heritage content on the Web is expected to have an impact on everyday life from the point of view of institutions, communities and individuals. In particular, collaborative environment scan recreate 3D navigable worlds that can offer new insights into our cultural heritage (Chan 2007). However, the main barrier is to find and relate cultural heritage information by end-users of cultural contents, as well as by organisations and communities managing and producing them. In this paper, we explore several visualisation techniques for supporting cultural interfaces, where the role of metadata is essential for supporting the search and communication among end-users (Figure 2). A conceptual framework was developed to integrate the data, purpose, technology, impact, and form components of a collaborative environment, Our preliminary results show that collaborative environments can help with cultural heritage information sharing and communication tasks because of the way in which they provide a visual context to end-users. They can be regarded as distributed virtual reality systems that offer graphically realised, potentially infinite, digital information landscapes. Moreover, collaborative environments also provide a new way of interaction between an end-user and a cultural heritage data set. Finally, the visualisation of metadata of a dataset plays an important role in helping end-users in their search for heritage contents on the Web.",

    "abstract": "This article concerns the path taken during my scientific research related to the construction and management of digital assets for the design, development, and management of databases, within the scope of the INET-md in Portugal. Its general objective is to facilitate the interoperability, Web dissemination, search, and retrieval of the INET-md’s digital collections. This investigation aims to reinforce the alliance between the areas of Information Science and Computer Science. From the Information Science, it brings the applications used for organization,management, and publication of digital assets collections on the Web; and from the Computer Science, it brings syntactic concepts (metadata and protocols) to communicate and exchange data and semantic concepts (ontologies and semantic annotations) to describe data. Both types of concepts can promote interoperability between distinct digital repositories and platforms, providing improvements in information search and retrieval activities.",

    "abstract": "It is often said that digital technologies are revolutionizing the social sciences, much as they revolutionized the natural sciences a few decades ago. This is not the case. The situation in the social sciences is more like that of the natural sciences in the 15th century, just after the introduction of the printing press. In The Printing Press as an Agent of Change, Elizabeth Eisenstein (1979) thoroughly describes how the introduction of the press triggered the Scientific Revolution of the XVI century. Yet, as Eisenstein makes very clear, the revolution did not broke overnight. Several decades after Gutenberg invention, naturalists were still printing the same mistakes they used to hand-copy. It was only after press attained a certain level of maturity and circulation that it started to have a real impact on the natural sciences.",

    "abstract": "In July, 1995 the first issue of D-Lib Magazine was published as an on-line, HTML-only, open access magazine, serving as the focal point for the then emerging digital library research community. In 2017 it ceased publication, in part due to the maturity of the community it served as well as the increasing availability of and competition from eprints, institutional repositories, conferences, social media, and online journals – the very ecosystem that D-Lib Magazine nurtured and enabled. As long-time members of the digital library community and authors with the most contributions to D-Lib Magazine, we reflect on the history of the digital library community and D-Lib Magazine, taking its very first issue as guidance. It contained three articles, which described: the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, a project status report from the NSF/DARPA/NASA-funded Digital Library Initiative (DLI), and a summary of the Kahn-Wilensky Framework (KWF) which gave us, among other things, Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). These technologies, as well as many more described in D-Lib Magazine through its 23 years, have had a profound and continuing impact on the digital library and general web communities.",

    "abstract": "Problems at the intersection of vision and language are of significant importance both as challenging research questions and for the rich set of applications they enable. However, inherent structure in our world and bias in our language tend to be a simpler signal for learning than visual modalities, resulting in models that ignore visual information, leading to an inflated sense of their capability. We propose to counter these language priors for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and make vision (the V in VQA) matter! Specifically, we balance the popular VQA dataset by collecting complementary images such that every question in our balanced dataset is associated with not just a single image, but rather a pair of similar images that result in two different answers to the question. Our dataset is by construction more balanced than the original VQA dataset and has approximately twice the number of image-question pairs. Our complete balanced dataset is publicly available at www.visualqa.org as part of the 2nd iteration of the Visual Question Answering Dataset and Challenge (VQA v2.0). We further benchmark a number of state-of-art VQA models on our balanced dataset. All models perform significantly worse on our balanced dataset, suggesting that these models have indeed learned to exploit language priors. This finding provides the first concrete empirical evidence for what seems to be a qualitative sense among practitioners. Finally, our data collection protocol for identifying complementary images enables us to develop a novel interpretable model, which in addition to providing an answer to the given (image, question) pair, also provides a counter-example based explanation. Specifically, it identifies an image that is similar to the original image, but it believes has a different answer to the same question. This can help in building trust for machines among their users.",

    "abstract": "Developments in AI research have dramatically changed what we can do with data and how we can learn from data. At the same time, implementations of AI amplify the prejudices in data often framed as “data bias” and “algorithmic bias.” Libraries, tasked with deciding what is worth keeping, are inherently discriminatory and yet remain trusted sources of information. As libraries begin to systematically approach their collections as data, will they be able to adopt and adapt the AI-driven tools to traditional practices?   Drawing on the work of the AI initiative within Stanford Libraries, the Fantastic Futures conference on AI for libraries, archives, and museums, and recent scholarship on data bias and algorithmic bias, this article encourages libraries to engage critically with AI and help shape applications of the technology to reflect the ethos of libraries for the benefit of libraries themselves and the patrons they serve. A brief examination of two core concepts in machine learning, generalization and unstructured data, provides points of comparison to library practices in order to uncover the theoretical assumptions driving the different domains. The comparison also offers a point of entry for libraries to adopt machine learning methods on their own terms.",

    "abstract": "Visual question answering has recently been settled as a fundamental multi-modal reasoning task of artificial intelligence that allows users to get information about visual content by asking questions in natural language. In the cultural heritage domain, this task can contribute to assisting visitors in museums and cultural sites, thus increasing engagement. However, the development of visual question answering models for cultural heritage is prevented by the lack of suitable large-scale datasets. To meet this demand, we built a large-scale heterogeneous and multilingual (Italian and English) dataset for cultural heritage that comprises approximately 500K Italian cultural assets and 6.5M question-answer pairs. We propose a novel formulation of the task that requires reasoning over both the visual content and an associated natural language description, and present baselines for this task. Results show that the current state of the art is reasonably effective but still far from satisfactory; therefore, further research in this area is recommended. Nonetheless, we also present a holistic baseline to address visual and contextual questions and foster future research on the topic.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe FAIR principles (Wilkinson et al. 2016) are fundamental for data discovery, sharing, consumption and reuse; however their broad interpretation and many ways to implement can lead to inconsistencies and incompatibility (Jacobsen et al. 2020).The European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) has been instrumental in maturing and encouraging FAIR practices across a wide range of research areas. Linked Data in the form of RDF (Resource Description Framework) is the common way to implement machine-readability in FAIR, however the principles do not prescribe RDF or any particular technology (Mons et al. 2017).FAIR Digital ObjectFAIR Digital Object (FDO) (Schultes and Wittenburg 2019) has been proposed to improve researcher’s access to digital objects through formalising their metadata, types, identifiers and exposing their computational operations, making them actionable FAIR objects rather than passive data sources. FDO is a set of principles (Bonino et al. 2019), implementable in multiple ways. Current realisations mostly use Digital Object Interface Protocol (DOIPv2) (DONA Foundation 2018), with the main implementation CORDRA. We can consider DOIPv2 as a simplified combination of object-oriented (CORBA, SOAP) and document-based (HTTP, FTP) approaches.More recently, the FDO Forum has prepared detailed recommendations, currently open for comments, including a DOIP endorsement and updated FDO requirements. These point out Linked Data as another possible technology stack, which is the focus of this work.Linked DataLinked Data standards (LD), based on the Web architecture, are commonplace in sciences like bioinformatics, chemistry and medical informatics – in particular to publish Open Data as machine-readable resources. LD has become ubiquitous on the general Web, the schema.org vocabulary is used by over 10 million sites for indexing by search engines – 43% of all websites use JSON-LD.Although LD practices align to FAIR (Hasnain and Rebholz-Schuhmann 2018), they do not fully encompass active aspects of FDOs. The HTTP protocol is used heavily for applications (e.g. mobile apps and cloud services), with REST APIs of customised JSON structures. Approaches that merge the LD and REST worlds include Linked Data Platform (LDP), Hydra and Web Payments.Meeting FDO principles using Linked Data standardsConsidering the potential of FDOs when combined with the mature technology stack of LD, here we briefly discuss how FDO principles in Bonino et al. (2019) can be achieved using existing standards. The general principles (G1–G9) apply well: Open standards with HTTP being stable for 30 years, JSON-LD is widely used, FAIR practitioners mainly use RDF, and a clear abstraction between the RDF model with stable bindings available in multiple serialisations. However, when considering the specific principles (FDOF1–FDOF12) we find that additional constraints and best practices need to be established – arbitrary LD resources cannot be assumed to follow FDO principles. This is equivalent to how existing use of DOIP is not FDO-compliant without additional constraints.Namely, persistent identifiers (PIDs) (McMurry et al. 2017) (FDOF1) are common in LD world (e.g. using http://purl.org/ or https://w3id.org/), however they don’t always have a declared type (FDOF2), or the PID may not even appear in the metadata. URL-based PIDs are resolvable (FDOF3), typically over HTTP using redirections and content-negotiation. One great advantage of RDF is that all attributes are defined semantic artefacts with PIDs (FDOF4), and attributes can be reused across vocabularies. While CRUD operations (FDOF6) are supported by native HTTP operations (GET/PUT/POST/DELETE) as in LDP , there is little consistency on how to define operation interfaces in LD (FDOF5). Existing REST approaches like OpenAPI and URI templates are mature and good candidates, and should be related to defined types to support machine-actionable composition (FDOF7). HTTP error code 410 Gone is used in tombstone pages for removed resources (FDOF12), although more frequent is 404 Not Found.Metadata is resolved to HTTP documents with their own URIs, but these frequently don’t have their own PID (FDOF8). RDF-Star and nanopublications (Kuhn et al. 2021) give ways to identify and trace provenance of individual assertions. Different metadata levels (FDOF9) are frequently developed for LD vocabularies across different communities (FDOF10), such as FHIR for health data, Bioschemas for bioinformatics and &gt;1000 more specific bioontologies. Increased declaration and navigation of profiles is therefore essential for machine-actionability and consistent consumption across FAIR endpoints. Several standards exist for rich collections (FDOF11), e.g. OAI-ORE, DCAT, RO-Crate, LDP. These are used and extended heterogeneously across the Web, but consistent machine-actionable FDOs will need specific choices of core standards and vocabularies. Another challenge is when multiple PIDs refer to “almost the same” concept in different collections – significant effort have created manual and automated semantic mappings (Baker et al. 2013, de Mello et al. 2022).Currently the FDO Forum has suggested the use of LDP as a possible alternative for implementing FAIR Digital Objects (Bonino da Silva Santos 2021), which proposes a novel approach of content-negotiation with custom media types. DiscussionThe Linked Data stack provides a set of specifications, tools and guidelines in order to help the FDO principles become a reality. This mature approach can accelerate uptake of FDO by scholars and existing research infrastructures such as the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). However, the amount of standards and existing metadata vocabularies poses a potential threat for adoption and interoperability. Yet, the challenges for agreeing on usage profiles apply equally to DOIP as LD approaches.We have worked with different scientific communities to define RO-Crate (Soiland-Reyes et al. 2022), a lightweight method to package research outputs along with their metadata. While RO-Crate’s use of schema.org shows just one possible metadata model, it’s powerful enough to be able to express FDOs, and familiar to web developers.We have also used FAIR Signposting (Van de Sompel et al. 2022) with HTTP Link: headers as a way to support navigation to the individual core properties of an FDO (PID, type, metadata, licence, bytestream) that does not require heuristics of content-negotiation and is agnostic to particular metadata vocabularies and serialisations.We believe that by adopting Linked Data principles, we can accelerate FDO today – and even start building practical ways to assist scientists in efficiently answering topical questions based on knowledge graphs.",

    "abstract": "This chapter proposes a conceptual framework to understand digital materiality. Referring to Information Infrastructure Studies and authors dealing with the issue of materiality, we focus on the construction of fluidity, which is generally presented as an intrinsic characteristic of the digital. A close ethnographic study looks at a digitization project, which aims to preserve and promote the Montreux Jazz Festival archive. Following the work of engineers and researchers in charge of the destiny of this piece of heritage, we account for how they struggle to shape musical-digital objects and make them fluid in order to irrigate a network of technological artifacts assuring the promotion of the archive. The chapter shows how the transformation of the material stages the shaping of autonomous elements such as songs extracted from concerts recordings. We demonstrate that during digitization, the material of the recordings deploys through mediators and associations that have to be set up. The resulting material infrastructure does not exhaust the “thing” coming to life (digital pieces of music) through an interactional dynamic. The transformations of the material largely overflow the material infrastructure. This process stages negotiations and compromises with the material. Neither digital materiality nor its fluidity is given but results of processes the chapter shows how to document.",

What are the implications of viewing large-scale cultural heritage data as an economic resource, to build new products and services upon? Drawing upon valuation studies, we reflect on both the theory and practicalities of using mass-digitised heritage content as an economic driver, stressing the need to consider the complexity of commercial-based outcomes within the context of cultural and creative industries. However, we also problematise the act of considering such heritage content as a resource to be exploited for economic growth, in order to inform how we consider, develop, deliver and value mass-digitisation.

    "abstract": "In research and policies, the identification of trends as well as emerging topics and topics in decline is an important source of information for both academic and innovation management. Since at present policy analysis mostly employs qualitative research methods, the following article presents and assesses different approaches – trend analysis based on questionnaires, quantitative bibliometric surveys, the use of computer-linguistic approaches and machine learning and qualitative investigations. Against this backdrop, this article examines digital applications in cultural heritage and, in particular, built heritage via various investigative frameworks to identify topics of relevance and trendlines, mainly for European Union (EU)-based research and policies. Furthermore, this article exemplifies and assesses the specific opportunities and limitations of the different methodical approaches against the backdrop of data-driven vs. data-guided analytical frameworks. As its major findings, our study shows that both research and policies related to digital applications for cultural heritage are mainly driven by the availability of new technologies. Since policies focus on meta-topics such as digitisation, openness or automation, the research descriptors are more granular. In general, data-driven approaches are promising for identifying topics and trendlines and even predicting the development of near future trends. Conversely, qualitative approaches are able to answer “why” questions with regard to whether topics are emerging due to disruptive innovations or due to new terminologies or whether topics are becoming obsolete because they are common knowledge, as is the case for the term “internet”.",

    "abstract": "Philosophers have relied on visual metaphors to analyse ideas and explain their theories at least since Plato. Descartes is famous for his system of axes, and Wittgenstein for his first design of truth table diagrams. Today, visualisation is a form of “computer-aided seeing” information in data. Hence, information is the fundamental “currency” exchanged through a visualisation pipeline. In this article, we examine the types of information that may occur at different stages of a general visualization pipeline. We do so from a quantitative and a qualitative perspective. The quantitative analysis is developed on the basis of Shannon’s information theory. The qualitative analysis is developed on the basis of Floridi’s taxonomy in the philosophy of information. We then discuss in detail how the condition of the “data processing inequality” can be broken in a visualisation pipeline. This theoretic finding underlines the usefulness and importance of visualisation in dealing with the increasing problem of data deluge. We show that the subject of visualisation should be studied using both qualitative and quantitative approaches, preferably in an interdisciplinary synergy between information theory and the philosophy of information.",

    "abstract": "This presentation introduces the infrastructure and services of the Swiss National Data and Service Center for the Humanitites (DaSCH) for researchers and research ITs. DaSCH develops and operates a FAIR long- term repository and a generic virtual research environment for complex and simple open research data in the Humanities in Switzerland, including law and theology. The primary goal of our platform is to guarantee direct access to the research data: it brings your data to life and keeps it alive in the long run. At the same time, it lets you edit, delete and enrich your data, even after it has been archived. Each object within a dataset has its own persistent identifier to allow reliable citability. We set value on interoperability with tools used by the Humanities and Cultural Sciences communities and foster the use of standards. The data is also accessible via an API, which allows computer scientists to collect data in an automated way. Our services for researchers and the community include hands-on training in the use of the DaSCH infrastructure, workshops thematizing frequently asked questions by researchers when writing a data management plan, participation in lectures, or workshops about best practices in the management and (re-)use of qualitative data in humanities research. As the coordinating institution and representative of Switzerland in DARIAH members of DaSCH actively engage in community building within Switzerland and abroad.",

    "abstract": "Although a vast amount of digitised content has been created relating to our world-leading cultural heritage collections, digital resources often languish in institutional silos without the ability to combine or cross-reference them. The “Practical Applications of IIIF as a Building Block Towards a National Collection” project has highlighted and demonstrated the opportunities and benefits the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) open standard can offer to institutions, researchers, scholars, and students to open up these silos and to describe, present and re-use digital resources at scale. The project has explored how IIIF can virtually connect digitised collections from different organisations and how these digital resources can be used as the foundations for further research. It has experimented with presenting IIIF resources for utilisation by diverse audiences and considered ways in which IIIF can be used to lower barriers to uptake as well as create new opportunities for digital re-interpretation and presentation. Efficient methods of using IIIF to build collaborative online resources have also been explored to begin to demonstrate the potential for dynamic, cross collection searching. As the organisation, presentation and re-use of digital resources would be a fundamental element of a digital National Collection, the project sought to highlight how the consistent advocacy for, use and ongoing support of this type of established and mature set of interoperable open standards is the only realistic way of connecting, at a national level, hundreds if not thousands of collections and sources of digital resources together in an economically feasible and sustainable manner. The project findings show that IIIF is a mature, established ecosystem, and operates beyond a purely presentational layer. Adoption of this shared standard will ultimately drive down delivery costs while providing a standardised base for a user experience, that has the opportunity and potential to be built upon by various initiatives (as shown with the project demonstrators).",

    "abstract": "There is no consensus yet on the definition of semantic information. This paper contributes to the current debate by criticising and revising the Standard Definition of semantic Information (SDI) as meaningful data, in favour of the Dretske-Grice approach: meaningful and well-formed data constitute semantic information only if they also qualify as contingently truthful. After a brief introduction, SDI is criticised for providing necessary but insufficient conditions for the definition of semantic information. SDI is incorrect because truth-values do not supervene on semantic information, and misinformation (that is, false semantic information) is not a type of semantic information, but pseudo-information, that is not semantic information at all. This is shown by arguing that none of the reasons for interpreting misinformation as a type of semantic information is convincing, whilst there are compelling reasons to treat it as pseudo-information. As a consequence, SDI is revised to include a necessary truth-condition. The last section summarises the main results of the paper and indicates some interesting areas of application of the revised definition.",

    "abstract": "While the epistemological affordances and varied impacts of different media on archaeological knowledge production have been scrutinized by many practitioners in recent decades, sources of digital structured data (e.g., spreadsheets, traditional relational databases, content management systems) have seen far less critical enquiry. Structured digital data are often venerated for their capacities to facilitate interoperability, equitable data exchange, democratic forms of engagement with, and widespread reuse of archaeological records, yet their constraints on our knowledge formation processes are arguably profound and deserving of detailed interrogation. In this article, we discuss what we call the emerging supremacy of structured digital data in archaeology and seek to question the consequences of their ubiquity. We ground our argument in a case study of a range of texts produced by practitioners working on the Çatalhöyük Research Project. We attempt to map short excerpts from these texts to structured data via the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model. This exercise allows making preliminary observations about the representational affordances and resistances of texts (which can be considered as a type of semi- or unstructured data) and structured data. Ultimately, we argue that the push to create more and more structured and structurable data needs to be tempered by a more inclusive digital practice in archaeology that protects difference, incommensurability, and interpretative nuance.",

    "abstract": "IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) is a collection of open web standards, broadly used for presenting and annotating high resolution images and audiovisual content, adopted by hundreds of GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives, museums) organisations worldwide, and permit the reuse and recombination of digital assets across traditional digital institutional boundaries. While these standards have been successful for 2D images and AV (Audio/Video) data, there is a growing interest in how they might be applied to 3D content. An example of this would be to combine shards of pottery from disparate collections into a single whole within a viewing experience. The IIIF 3D Community Group has been collaboratively considering common challenges and potential solutions to key areas, with major 3D developers and researchers, and ongoing dialogue with VIGIE2020/654 study colleagues, forming the IIIF 3D Technical Specification Group, engaging even more widely with other specialists and representatives across user communities and standards bodies.",

    "abstract": "The web began with a vision of, as stated by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, \"that much academic information should be freely available to anyone\". For many years, the development of the web and the development of digital libraries and other scholarly communications infrastructure proceeded in tandem. A milestone occurred in July, 1995, when the first issue of D-Lib Magazine was published as an online, HTML-only, open access magazine, serving as the focal point for the then emerging digital library research community. In 2017 it ceased publication, in part due to the maturity of the community it served as well as the increasing availability of and competition from eprints, institutional repositories, conferences, social media, and online journals - the very ecosystem that D-Lib Magazine nurtured and enabled. As long-time members of the digital library community and frequent contributors to D-Lib Magazine, we reflect on the many innovations that D-Lib Magazine pioneered and were made possible by the web, including: open access, HTML-only publication and embracing the hypermedia opportunities afforded by HTML, persistent identifiers and stable URLs, rapid publication, and community engagement. Although it ceased publication after 22 years and 265 issues, it remains unchanged on the live web and still provides a benchmark for academic serials and web-based publishing.",

    "abstract": "Cultural heritage consists of heterogeneous resources: archaeological artefacts, monuments, sites, landscapes, paintings, photos, books and expressions of human creativity, often enjoyed in different forms: tangible, intangible or digital. Each resource is usually documented, conserved and managed by cultural institutes like museums, libraries or holders of archives. These institutes make available a detailed description of the objects as catalog records. In this context, the chapter proposes both a classification of cultural heritage data types and a process for cultural heritage valorisation through the well-known Linked Open Data paradigm. The classification and process have been defined in the context of a collaboration between the Semantic Technology Laboratory of the National Research Council (STLab) and the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism (MIBACT) that the chapter describes, although we claim they are sufficiently general to be adopted in every cultural heritage scenario. In particular, the chapter introduces both a suite of ontology modules named Cultural-ON to model the principal elements identified in the cultural heritage data type classification, and the process we employed for data valorisation purposes. To this end, semantic technologies are exploited; that is, technologies that allow us to conceptualise and describe the meaning of data forming the cultural heritage and including such entities as places, institutions, cultural heritage events, availability, etc. These entities have special characteristics and are connected with each other in a profound way. The result is a knowledge base consisting of semantic interconnections with also other data available in the Web to be exploited according to different tasks and users preferences. By navigating the semantic relationships between the various objects of the knowledge base, new semantic paths can be revealed and utilised with the aim to develop innovative services and applications. The process is compliant with Linked Open Data and W3C Semantic Web best practices so that to enable a wider promotion of cultural heritage, and of sharing and reuse of cultural heritage data in the Web. The chapter concludes presenting a number of methodological principles and lessons learnt from the STLab/MIBACT collaboration that are applicable to any cultural heritage context and, in some cases, also to other domains.",

    "abstract": "A new movement in urban environmental policy, the circular economy (CE), aims to change how Europeans consume and produce materials and energy. Cities are taking up the CE challenge. This research inquires whether the infant CE programs in European cities include cultural heritage and adaptive reuse of cultural heritage (ARCH) buildings. ARCH buildings exemplify the central principal of the CE, which is a temporally long service life with multiple uses for several generations of users. In addition, culture and cultural heritage buildings are established drivers of socioeconomic development, urban landscape, and identity. Hypothetically, cultural heritage and adaptive reuse of cultural heritage (ARCH) buildings should be prominently included in European cities’ CE programs, particularly those cities that are highly ranked on the 2019 European Cultural and Creative Cities Monitor (Monitor). To test this hypothesis, this study creates a novel dataset that profiles the existing circular city plans of 190 European cities included in the Monitor’s ranking. Contrary to the hypothesis, just seven percent of cities in the dataset include cultural heritage. European cities are missing an opportunity to achieve their CE goals and preserve their unique identities as embodied in the built environment.",

    "abstract": "The Web is increasingly understood as a global information space consisting not just of linked documents, but also of Linked Data. More than just a vision, the resulting Web of Data has been brought into being by the maturing of the Semantic Web technology stack, and by the publication of an increasing number of datasets according to the principles of Linked Data. The Linked Data on the Web (LDOW2008) workshop brings together researchers and practitioners working on all aspects of Linked Data. The workshop provides a forum to present the state of the art in the field and to discuss ongoing and future research challenges. In this workshop summary we will outline the technical context in which Linked Data is situated, describe developments in the past year through initiatives such as the Linking Open Data community project, and look ahead to the workshop itself.",

    "abstract": "Modal logic is an intrinsically intensional logic, suitable only for applications such as reasoning about necessity, possibility, and knowledge. Description logics are undeniably modal logics but are extremely well suited for reasoning about ordinary individuals and the relations between them. The basic components of description logics are concept languages, terminological formalisms, and assertional formalisms. The concept language ALC is only one member of a large family of concept languages. The chapter introduces syntax and semantics of the basic description logics (DL) ALC, and shows its relationship to multi-modal K. It then discusses additional DL constructors and describes their modal logics (ML) counterparts. In addition to these constructors, DLs provide their users with a terminological formalism, which allows introducing names for complex concepts, and an assertional formalism, which allows stating facts about specific individuals/objects. The known complexity results for DLs and structural subsumption algorithms for some of them are described. The bi-simulation characterizations of the corresponding ML fragments are also considered. Some non-standard inferences in DLs and means of expressiveness that do not have immediate ML counterparts are introduced.",

    "abstract": "Among the Gouro masks, Zamble, a composite animal figure, and Gù, a fine-featured woman’s face, are known to art lovers around the world. Today their profane avatars, Flali and Zaouli, are at the heart of masquerades that are much enjoyed by audiences. But this appreciation concerns only the “pretty” aspects, that is to say the civilized and orderly side of an ensemble that also has a reverse side: the disease masks, sprung from disorder, avatars of the more powerful Zàùlì, described as the wild brother or husband of Zamble in the genealogical idiom employed by the Gouro when referring to the masks. These masks are created by each generation of young people and are central figures in rituals of inversion that express the upheavals of the times. At the same time as they establish their creators’ reputations, they serve as a record of these events for the Gouro. Descended from the initial trio of masks (Zàùlì, Zamble, Gù), they prolong the trend to secularization of this family of masks from the sacred wood. In tracking this tradition over twenty years we can see a process of resacralization. When the youths’ comments are analysed in the light of encyclopaedic knowledge acquired in the course of anthropological research on health, we can understand the necessity of the mask figure, and going further can understand what an ugly profane mask is, what it presents and the role it plays. In return the Zamble mask and its associates take on another dimension, a dimension that opens up exploration of the unknown via their intrinsic ambiguity and the transgressive behaviour they allow during the time of the ritual., Parmi les masques Gouro, Zamble, figure animale composite, et Gù, fin visage de femme, sont internationalement connus des amateurs d’art. Leurs avatars profanes actuels, Flali et Zaouli, sont au centre de mascarades très prisées du public. Mais il s’agit là du seul aspect « joli », c’est-à-dire civil, conforme à l’ordre, d’un ensemble comportant son envers, les masques maladies, laids, issus du désordre, avatars du plus puissant Zàùlì, frère sauvage, ou mari, de Zamble, dans l’idiome généalogique employé par les Gouro à leur propos. Ces masques mis en place à chaque génération de jeunes sont au centre de rituels d’inversions où se disent les bouleversements de l’époque. Tout en établissant la renommée de leurs créateurs, ils valent comme trace de ces évènements pour les Gouro. Issus du trio initial de masques (Zàùlì, Zamble, Gù) ils prolongent la tendance à la sécularisation de cette famille de masques sortie du bois sacré. Mais le suivi sur vingt ans de cette tradition permet de mettre en évidence un processus de resacralisation. Analyser les commentaires des jeunes à la lumière des connaissances encyclopédiques acquises dans le cadre de recherches en anthropologie de la santé permet de comprendre à quoi correspond la nécessité de la figure du masque et au-delà ce qu’est un masque profane laid, ce qu’il représente, quel est son rôle. En retour, le masque Zamble et ses comparses prennent une autre dimension, celle d’ouvrir à l’exploration de l’inconnu grâce à l’ambiguïté qui leur est intrinsèque et les comportements transgressifs qu’ils s’autorisent, le temps du rituel.",

    "abstract": "From its beginnings and until January 2000, Romanian archaeology did not benefit from a specific legislation. The lack of specialised administrative structures that support initiatives and of a set of minimal rules or of a unique system of professional licensing has had negative effects such as the lack of any legislative initiative concerning archaeology, the perpetuation of old, customary standards with relative application in archaeological diggings and in the interpretation of professional criteria and quality, the lack of any legal duty to report diggings results (except for the standards of certain institutions), and the lack of higher education in the field. Despite the fact that Romania has been a member of the European Convention concerning the archaeological heritage (signed at La Valetta on January 16, 1992) ever since 1997, it was only in 2000 that they enacted the first law concerning the protection of the archaeological heritage. Law No. 462 from 2003 defined from a legal point of view the types of archaeological research, classifying them into systematic, preventive, and salvation, introduced the “polluter pays” principle, and contained measures for the prevention of archaeological poaching. However, the law omitted taking measures against the second major enemy of archaeological sites, after manmade destruction: natural hazard. The present study is an analysis of the consequences of the non-involvement of centralised and local public administration, as well as of civil society, in general, in the protection, conservation, and capitalisation of the archaeological heritage subjected to both natural (increasingly frequent) and manmade destruction in the Romania of the 21st century.",

    "abstract": "Diversified transnational criminal activities coupled with broader geographic capabilities have turned the black and white line between the licit “upperworld” and the illicit underworld a murky shade of grey, and the illicit antiquities trade is no exception. This article highlights criminal dynamics of trafficking in looted antiquities from the perspective of the source end of the problem—that is, theft of antiquities from archaeological sites and their illicit export. Trafficking in antiquities is a crime of transnational proportions because it involves the illegal removal and export of cultural material from source countries, which supplies the demand generated from developed, rich, market economies.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of the concept of “cultural heritage” is a relatively recent achievement of international law. Over the years, the enthusiasm for the protection of cultural property has enriched the term of new shades of meaning, while maintaining the older ones. At the same time, “cultural heritage” is only one of the terms used in international treaties and other normative instruments. Hence, its comprehension needs to pass through a comparison of the other legal terminologies adopted. In such a context, the paper aims at providing a broad understanding of the idea of “cultural heritage” by investigating its origin and evolution in the legal framework. In order to do so, the analysis begins with a brief discussion of the notion of “culture” by analyzing how it has come to convey the current meanings. The paper then describes the main aspects influencing the linguistic choice within the field of Cultural Heritage Law. The central part of the paper deals with the different terminologies used to refer to cultural property within the international legal instruments (among them, 1954 Hague Convention, 1970 UNESCO Convention, and 1972 World Heritage Convention). Finally, the paper explores the existence of constructions of belongings in the legal terminologies examining the impact of territorial or communitarian linkage in the cultural legal discourse. The aim of this work is to reveal the inner system of interconnections in an effort to shed light on the multiple meanings of the term “cultural heritage” by exploring how the concept evolved within the socio-legal context over time and space.",

    "abstract": "Current debates about urban sustainability tend to focus on technical issues, such as carbon emissions, energy consumption and waste management, or on the economic aspects of urban regeneration and growth. Increasingly, however, governments recognise the contribution that built cultural heritage makes to the social well-being of different groups living within increasingly cosmopolitan towns and cities. Heritage is seen as a major component of quality of life, but the two main methods of identifying and protecting built heritage – the listing of individual monuments and buildings and designation of conservation areas – are unable to deal with less tangible features of townscape, such as street patterns. Yet it is often precisely these features that give a city its unique character and provide the sense of belonging that lies at the core of cultural identity. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to examine the role that built cultural heritage can play within sustainable urban development. The paper considers changing definitions of built heritage before outlining the broad contribution it can make to sustainable urban development. The paper then considers how the built environment contributes to the satisfaction of human needs by providing symbolic meanings that bind cultural groups and communities across generations. Results from the development and application of a novel survey method, designed to assess different people’s perceptions of and attitudes to urban historical areas, are presented before describing a case study of recent urban development in Belfast that highlights the problems of intangible heritage. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of shortcomings of existing approaches to urban regeneration and suggests how these might be overcome through a greater understanding of how people interact with the urban environment and its heritage.",

More specifically, thephilosophy of computer science considers the ontology and epistemologyof computational systems, focusing on problems associated with theirspecification, programming, implementation, verification and testing.The complex nature of computer programs ensures that many of theconceptual questions raised by the philosophy of computer science haverelated ones in the philosophy of mathematics, the philosophy of empirical sciences, and the philosophy of technology. We shall provide an analysis of such topics that reflects the layerednature of the ontology of computational systems in Sections 1–5;we then discuss topics involved in their methodology in Sections6–8.",

    "abstract": "Abstraction is arguably one of the most important methods in modern science in analysing and understanding complex phenomena. In his book The Philosophy of Information, Floridi (The philosophy of information. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2011) presents the method of levels of abstraction as the main method of the Philosophy of Information. His discussion of abstraction as a method seems inspired by the formal methods and frameworks of computer science, in which abstraction is operationalised extensively in programming languages and design methodologies. Is it really clear what we should understand by levels of abstraction? How should they be specified? We will argue that levels of abstraction should be augmented with annotations, in order to express semantic information for them and reconcile the method of level of abstraction (LoA’s) with other approaches. We discuss the extended method when applied e.g. to the analysis of abstract machines. This will lead to an example in which the number of LoA’s is unbounded.",

    "abstract": "The notion of level of abstraction (LoA) is one of the foundations of the Floridi’s Philosophy of Information. It also serves for many practical purposes as in information ethics. But the notion of abstraction is not new; it has been given many different meanings in various fields, especially in scientific disciplines and, in particular, in computer science. Our purpose here is to examine the use of abstraction in Floridi’s works in conjunction with some of the meanings of abstraction in computer science. The article is divided into five sections. After a general introduction to the Floridi’s method of abstraction (MoA) in Section 1, Section 2 revisits Floridi’s definition of abstraction and Section 3 gives the different senses of abstraction in computer science. The Section 4 compares them with the Floridi’s LoAs and proposes to generalise the Floridi’s approach to abstraction using an abstraction of the LoAs, while Section 5 concludes on what we think to be some new arguments in favour of MoA and LoA.",

    "abstract": "The use of “levels of abstraction” in philosophical analysis (levelism) has recently come under attack. In this paper, I argue that a refined version of epistemological levelism should be retained as a fundamental method, called the method of levels of abstraction. After a brief introduction, in section “Some Definitions and Preliminary Examples” the nature and applicability of the epistemological method of levels of abstraction is clarified. In section “A Classic Application of the Method of Abstraction”, the philosophical fruitfulness of the new method is shown by using Kant’s classic discussion of the “antinomies of pure reason” as an example. In section “The Philosophy of the Method of Abstraction”, the method is further specified and supported by distinguishing it from three other forms of “levelism”: (i) levels of organisation; (ii) levels of explanation and (iii) conceptual schemes. In that context, the problems of relativism and antirealism are also briefly addressed. The conclusion discusses some of the work that lies ahead, two potential limitations of the method and some results that have already been obtained by applying the method to some long-standing philosophical problems.",

    "abstract": "Depuis quelques années, un nouveau concept circule: le patrimoine culturel immatériel. Il regroupe des activités telles que musiques et danses traditionnelles, rites et rituels, savoir-faire artisanaux et connaissances populaires. En adhérant en 2008 à la Convention de l’UNESCO pour la sauvegarde de ce patrimoine, la Suisse s’est engagée à en faire l’inventaire sur son territoire, sous la forme d’une «Liste des traditions vivantes». Ce livre saisit l’occasion des dix ans de cette adhésion pour faire le point sur le sens et les effets de ce nouveau dispositif patrimonial, qui représente un facteur de cohésion sociale et d’ancrage identitaire crucial pour toute collectivité. S’engager à le sauvegarder, c’est fournir l’occasion d’honorer le passé et de débattre de l’avenir. Que voulons-nous garder des pratiques et croyances de nos aïeuls? La réponse à cette question passe nécessairement par une réflexion sur les politiques de la tradition, en Suisse et sur la scène internationale.",

    "abstract": "Since the establishment of UNESCO, the organization has engaged in the protection of cultural property during armed conflict. Recently, however, an increased incidence of intentional cultural property destruction and looting has been observed during such conflicts. This article, therefore, evaluates UNESCO activities relating to the protection of cultural property during armed conflicts. It finds that the ineffectiveness of the measures employed is largely due to a lack of adjustment to the nature of contemporary conflicts and to changes in the profiles and motives of the perpetrators. Further problems, such as the slow operation and implementation procedures of the organization and its lack of pre-emptive actions, are also addressed.",

    "abstract": "Since the adoption of the Venice Charter in 1964, there have been many conservation guidelines in the form of charters, recommendations and resolutions that have been introduced and adopted by international organisations such as UNESCO and ICOMOS. This article focuses on the scope and definition of heritage as promulgated by the various charters across the globe. The term “historic monument” used in the Venice Charter 1964 was reinterpreted by ICOMOS in 1965 as “monument” and “site”; and by UNESCO in 1968 as “cultural property” to include both movable and immovable. The different terminology between the UNESCO and ICOMOS was reconciled at the World Heritage Convention 1972. At national and regional levels the scope of heritage was broadened to include gardens, landscape and environment, and later reinterpreted and defined quite differently in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and China. Although the scope of heritage, in general, is now agreed internationally to include “tangible” and “intangible” as well as “environments”, the finer terminology of “heritage” has not been streamlined or standardised, and thus no uniformity exists between countries.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this work is to analyse the evolution of the concept of cultural heritage in West European states. In the last decades of the 20thcentury, the term “heritage” was characterised by expansion and semantic transfer, resulting in a generalisation of the use of this word, frequently used in the place of another, such as, monument and cultural property. However, all these terms are not able to cover the same semantic field. Starting by the reflection on the semantic evolution of the notion of cultural heritage in France, we approach to the international definition of heritage given by the directives, charters and international resolutions in order to define a global outline of the meaning of heritage that is not just limited to a particular national dimension. From a purely normative approach, one went to a less restrictive approach, one based on the capacity of the object to arouse certain values that led the society in question to consider it as heritage and therefore, to a further step in which heritage is no longer defined on the basis of its material aspect. This development has also made it possible to recognise intangible cultural heritage, which was ignored for a long time, as heritage to be protected and safeguarded.",

    "abstract": "Wikidata is an outstanding data source with potential application in many scenarios. Wikidata provides its data openly in RDF. Our study aims to evaluate the usability of Wikidata as a data source for robots operating on the web of data, according to specifications and practices of linked data, the Semantic Web and ontology reasoning. We evaluated from the perspective of two use cases of data crawling robots, which are guided by our general motivation to acquire richer data for Europeana, a data aggregator from the Cultural Heritage domain. The first use case regards general data consumption applications based on RDF, RDF-Schema, OWL, SKOS and linked data. The second case regards applications that explore semantics relying on Schema.org and SKOS. We conclude that a human operator must assist linked data applications to interpret Wikidata’s RDF because of the choices that were taken at Wikidata in the definition of its expression in RDF. The semantics of the RDF output from Wikidata is “locked-in” by the usage of Wikidata’s own ontology, resulting in the need for human intervention. Wikidata is only a few steps away from high quality machine interpretation, however. It contains extensive alignment data to RDF, RDFS, OWL, SKOS and Schema.org, but a machine interpretation of those alignments can only be done if some essential Wikidata alignment properties are known.",

    "abstract": "Archaeologists, architects, engineers, materials specialists, teachers, curators and restorers of cultural property, contribute to the daily knowledge and conservation of heritage artefacts. For many years, the development of digital technologies has produced important results in the collection, visualisation and indexing of digital resources. Whilst these advances have made it possible to introduce new tools that are making documentation practices evolve within the cultural heritage community, the management of multi-dimensional and multi-format data introduces new problems and challenges, in particular the development of relevant analysis and interpretation methods, the sharing and correlation of heterogeneous data among several actors and contexts, and the centralised archiving of documentation results for long-term preservation purposes. Despite their different approaches and tools for observation, description and analysis, the actors of cultural heritage documentation all have a common interest and central focus: the heritage object, the physical one, whether it is a site, a building, a sculpture, a painting, a work of art, or an archaeological fragment. This is the starting point for the development of “Aïoli”, a reality-based 3D annotation platform, which allows a multidisciplinary community to build semantically-enriched 3D descriptions of heritage artefacts from simple images and spatialised annotations coupled with additional resources. Resulting from more than 10 years of methodological and technological contributions concerning different steps of the workflow starting from reality-based 3D reconstruction to the analysis of cultural heritage data, this platform introduces an innovative framework for the comprehensive, large-scale collaborative documentation of cultural heritage by integrating state-of-the-art technological components within a cloud infrastructure accessible via web interfaces from PCs, tablets and smartphones online and onsite. This paper aims to provide a synthesis of the work done to build it, to describe its main features, and to discuss the limitations and opportunities it raises for cultural heritage studies.",

    "abstract": "Intangible cultural heritage (ICH) as a field of research and site for digital efforts has grown significantly since the UNESCO 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Heritage. In contrast to tangible heritage, where cultural identities are manifested through physical objects, intangible cultural expressions are defined through tacit reliances and embodied practices. Such practices are usually bodily communicated, enacted, socially transmitted, and constantly evolving. Burgeoning trends in computational heritage and ICT applications have played a crucial role in safeguarding ICH as they produce versatile resources while making them accessible to the public. Nevertheless, most of the inventions are object-centric and cater to conserving material-based knowledge bases. Few endeavors thus far have fully supported the recording, representing, and reviving of the living nature of ICH. One of the challenges now faced is to find appropriate forms, together with efficient methods, to document the ephemeral aspects of intangible heritage. Another barrier is to find effective ways to communicate the knowledge inextricably linked to people. In response, recent efforts have embarked on capturing the “live” and “active” facets of the embodied cultures, which entails addressing technological and curatorial complexity to communicate the material and immaterial aspects within a meaningful context. Meanwhile, advancements in experimental museology have opened up new modes of experiential narratives, particularly through visualization, augmentation, participation, and immersive embodiment. Novel practices of cultural data computation and data sculpting have also emerged toward the ideal of knowledge reconstruction. This article outlines state-of-the-art models, projects, and technical practices that have advanced the digitization lifecycle for ICH resources. The review focuses on several critical but less studied tasks within digital archiving, computational encoding, conceptual representation, and interactive engagement with the intangible cultural elements. We aim at identifying the advancements and gaps in the existing conventions, and to envision opportunities for transmitting embodied knowledge in intangible heritage.",

    "abstract": "Europeana, a non-profit foundation launched in 2008, aims to improve access to Europe’s digital cultural heritage through its open data platform that aggregates metadata and links to digital surrogates held by over 3700 providers. The data comes both directly from cultural heritage institutions (libraries, archives, museums) as well as through intermediary aggregators. Europeana’s current operating model leverages the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) and the Europeana Data Model (EDM) for data import through Metis, Europeana’s ingestion and aggregation service.However, OAI-PMH is an outdated technology, and is not web-centric, which presents high maintenance implications, in particular for smaller institutions. Consequently, Europeana seeks to find alternative aggregation mechanisms that could complement or supersede it over the long-term, and which could also bring further potential benefits. In scope, this master’s thesis seeks to extend the research on earlier aggregation experiments that Europeana successfully carried out with various technologies, such as aggregation based on Linked Open Data (LOD) datasets or through the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) APIs.The literature review first focuses on metadata standards and the aggregation landscape in the cultural heritage domain, and then provides an extensive overview of Web-based technologies with respect to two essential components that enable aggregation: data transfer and synchronisation as well as data modelling and representation. Three key results were obtained. First, the participation in the Europeana Common Culture project resulted in the documentation revision of the LOD-aggregator, a generic toolset for harvesting and transforming LOD. Second, 52 respondents completed an online survey to gauge the awareness, interest, and use of technologies other than OAI-PMH for (meta)data aggregation. Third, an assessment of potential aggregation pilots was carried out considering the 23 organisations who expressed interest in follow-up experiments on the basis of the available data and existing implementations. In the allotted time, one pilot was attempted using Sitemaps and Schema.org.In order to encourage the adoption of new aggregation mechanisms, a list of proposed suggestions was then established. All of these recommendations were aligned with the Europeana Strategy 2020-2025 and directed towards one or several of the key roles of the aggregation workflow (data provider, aggregator, Europeana). Even if a shift in Europena’s operating model would require extensive human and technical resources, such an effort is clearly worthwhile as solutions presented in this dissertation are well-suited for data enrichment and for allowing data to be easily updated. The transition from OAI-PMH will also be facilitated by the integration of such mechanisms within the Metis Sandbox, Europeana’s new ad-hoc system where contributors will be able to test their data sources before ingestion into Metis. Ultimately, this shift is also expected to lead to a better discoverability of digital cultural heritage objects.",

    "abstract": "The International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF), an initiative born in 2011, defines a set of common application programming interfaces (APIs) to retrieve, display, manipulate, compare, and annotate digitised and born-digital images. Upon implementation, these technical specifications have offered institutions and end users alike new possibilities. In Switzerland, only a handful of organizations and projects have collaborated with the IIIF community. For instance, e-codices, the Virtual Manuscript Library, implemented in December 2014 the two core IIIF APIs (Image API and Presentation API). Since then, no other Swiss collection has fully complied with the IIIF specifications to make true interoperability possible. The NIE-INE project, overseen by the University of Basel and funded by Swissuniversities, has aimed to build a national platform for scientific editions. There is a shared rationale between NIE-INE and IIIF who both advocate flexible and consistent technical architecture as well as providing high-quality user experience (UX) in their content delivery. Remote and in-person usability tests were conducted on the Universal Viewer (UV) and Mirador, two IIIF-compliant image viewers deployed by many IIIF implementers, in order to assess their satisfaction and efficiency as well as their perceived usability. NIE-INE was the target audience of the usability testing with a view to evaluating how scholarly research and the wider scientific community could benefit from leveraging IIIF-compliant technology. To conclude this bachelor’s thesis, a set of recommendations, based on the usability testing results and throughout this assignment, was drawn for the developing teams of both viewers, the IIIF community and the NIE-INE team members.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article advances the thesis that three decades of investments by national and international funders, combined with those of scholars, technologists, librarians, archivists, and their institutions, have resulted in a digital infrastructure in the humanities that is now capable of supporting end-to-end research workflows. The article refers to key developments in the epigraphy and paleography of the premodern period. It draws primarily on work in classical studies but also highlights related work in the adjacent disciplines of Egyptology, ancient Near East studies, and medieval studies. The argument makes a case that much has been achieved but it does not declare “mission accomplished.” The capabilities of the infrastructure remain unevenly distributed within and across disciplines, institutions, and regions. Moreover, the components, including the links between steps in the workflow, are generally far from user-friendly and seamless in operation. Because further refinements and additional capacities are still much needed, the article concludes with a discussion of key priorities for future work.",

    "abstract": "Linked Data exploration is an essential task in the process of understanding, assessing, and using datasets made available in the Resource Description Framework (RDF) format. Current solutions for exploration of RDF data are mainly targeted at Semantic Web experts, require non-trivial deployments, and do not scale to the increasing amounts of data published in RDF. The lack of simple, intuitive, and efficient solutions for exploring RDF data, especially for lay users, is the main motivation behind the work presented in this paper. We propose RDF Surveyor, an easy-to-use and lightweight tool for exploring RDF datasets. Its visual interface hides the intricacies of Semantic Web technologies from the user, while providing intuitive overviews of datasets, class navigation, and visualization of class instances. Furthermore, RDF Surveyor does not require any installation and can handle large datasets such as DBpedia. We provide a detailed overview of RDF Surveyor and illustrate its capabilities in two different scenarios. We also analyze the uptake, performance and usability of RDF Surveyor, showing its suitability for exploring Linked Data at scale.",

    "abstract": "The term “actor network theory” (ANT) combines two words usually considered as opposites: actor and network. It is reminiscent of the old, traditional tensions at the heart of the social sciences, such as those between agency and structure or micro- and macro-analysis. Yet, ANT, also known as the sociology of translation, is not just another attempt to show the artificial or dialectical nature of these classical oppositions. On the contrary, its purpose is to show how they are constructed and to provide tools for analyzing that process. One of the core assumptions of ANT is that what the social sciences usually call “society” is an ongoing achievement. ANT is an attempt to provide analytical tools for explaining the very process by which society is constantly reconfigured. What distinguishes it from other constructivist approaches is its explanation of society in the making, in which science and technology play a key part.",

    "abstract": "Advances in open data, big data and data linkage allow us to analyse more data and on a larger scale than ever before. However, this brings with it the challenge of ensuring that Indigenous data sets are used in a way that protects Indigenous rights to that data and maximises benefits for Indigenous peoples. The CARE principles for Indigenous data governance-Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility and Ethics-were developed to protect Indigenous data sovereignty, but there are few examples of how to translate these principles into practice. In this paper, we show how these CARE principles can be applied to data collection, integration, analysis and translation practices. Our case study is a project that used data reported by Indigenous ranger groups to capture the multiple benefits of Indigenous land and water management activities. Through this case study, we offer a framework for the design and use of CARE-informed data practices, which can be embedded into project design to enable the ethical and responsible use of Indigenous data to improve Indigenous policies and services. Such practices are critical in the context of ongoing demand for Indigenous data for bureaucratic purposes, and Indigenous interest in using that data to influence management and policy decisions affecting their estates and resources.",

Der vorliegende Beitrag beschäftigt sich mit Fragen der Digitalisierung und der Öffnung digitaler Sammlungen und diskutiert, wie diese am besten als Daten für die Forschung zugänglich gemacht werden können. Ein Schwerpunkt liegt dabei auf historischen Zeitungen im Forschungskontext. Weiters wird auf das Konzept von „Collections as Data“ und die Rolle von GLAM Labs eingegangen, die in jüngster Zeit in vielen Bibliotheken, darunter auch in der Österreichischen Nationalbibliothek, eingerichtet wurden.",

    "abstract": "Wood identification is a key step in the enforcement of laws and regulations aimed at combatting illegal timber trade. Robust wood identification tools, capable of distinguishing a large number of timbers, depend on a solid database of reference material. Reference material for wood identification is typically curated in botanical collections dedicated to wood consisting of samples of secondary xylem of lignified plants. Specimens from the Tervuren Wood Collection, one of the large institutional wood collections around the world, are used as a source of tree species data with potential application as timber. Here, we present SmartWoodID, a database of high-resolution optical scans of the end-grain surfaces enriched with expert wood anatomical descriptions of macroscopic features. These can serve as annotated training data to develop interactive identification keys and artificial intelligence for computer vision–based wood identification. The first edition of the database consists of images of 1190 taxa, with a focus on potential timber species from the Democratic Republic of the Congo with at least four different specimens per species included.Database URLhttps://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12624/SmartWoodID_first_edition",

It contains medieval Latin handwritings coming from 11th–12th century and can be used to evaluate the performance of offline writer identification and to find the handwriting similarity between the writers, or to test the handwritten optical character recognition systems. It consists of 117 fragments of handwritten documents of medieval codices and contains in total over two thousand very high quality images. The collection was assembled using the IIIF standard. We describe the collecting and processing steps performed to develop the dataset and define several evaluation tasks regarding the use of this dataset.",

    "abstract": "This special issue brings together three areas of research and scholarly work areas that would have demonstrated few obvious relationships three decades ago. Digital libraries research, practices and infrastructures have transformed the study of ancient inscriptions by providing organizing principles for collections building, defining interoperability requirements and developing innovative user tools and services. Yet linking collections and their contents to support advanced scholarly work in epigraphy and paleography tests the limits of current digital libraries applications. This is due, in part, to the magnitude and heterogeneity of works created over a time period of more than five millennia. The remarkable diversity ranges from the number of types of artifacts to the methods used in their production to the singularity of individual marks contained within them. Conversion of analog collections to digital repositories is well underway—but most often not in a way that meets the basic requirements needed to support scholarly workflows. This is beginning to change. In addition to efforts to develop complex data objects, linking strategies and repositories aggregation, there is a new use of imaging technologies and computational approaches to recognize, enhance, recover and restore writings. Most recently, leading-edge artificial intelligence methods are being applied for the automated transcription of handwritten text into machine readable forms. The articles in this special issue will give examples of each.",

    "abstract": "Background: Systematic literature studies have become common in software engineering, and hence it is important to understand how to conduct them efficiently and reliably. Objective: This paper presents guidelines for conducting literature reviews using a snowballing approach, and they are illustrated and evaluated by replicating a published systematic literature review. Method: The guidelines are based on the experience from conducting several systematic literature reviews and experimenting with different approaches. Results: The guidelines for using snowballing as a way to search for relevant literature was successfully applied to a systematic literature review. Conclusions: It is concluded that using snowballing, as a first search strategy, may very well be a good alternative to the use of database searches.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses an emerging cloud of Linked Open Data in the humanities sometimes referred to as the Graph of Ancient World Data (GAWD). It provides historical background to the domain, before gong on to describe the open and decentralised characteristics which have partially characterised its development. This is done principally through the lens of Pelagios, a collaborative initiative led by the authors which connects online historical resources based on common references to places. The benefits and limitations of the approach are evaluated, in particular its low barrier to entry, open architecture and restricted scope. The paper concludes with a number of suggestion for encouraging the adoption of Linked Open Data within other humanities communities and beyond.",

    "abstract": "The accessibility of images-based resources is important for the practice of research, teaching and knowledge transfer in the Social Sciences and the Humanities. In the past twenty-five years, Cultural Heritage Institutions (CHIs) have been digitizing and providing millions of digital surrogates of their artefacts, paintings, books, maps, manuscripts and other objects in digital repositories and web platforms. However, most of those digital resources are still locked up in silos which means they lack interoperability and reusability. To address this issue, the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) was created in 2011 by technologists from Stanford University, The British Library and The Bodleian Library, The National Library of Norway and The National Library of France (BnF). This study will address the challenges and advantages of the IIIF’s implementation in digital repositories of CHIs and how the IIIF can enhance research, teaching and knowledge transfer in the social sciences and humanities. This study will also look at the IIIF implementation scenario in Europe and in Portugal through qualitative analysis of professionals’ responses to a questionnaire.",

    "abstract": "The availability of interoperability standards allows using a uniform model for integrating technologies and designing collaborating applications with a shared understanding of the exchanged information. In this perspective, we propose here the design and development of an agent-based platform that uses an interoperability framework to build a diffused museum in a cyber-physical system, where intelligent agents deliver cultural content through innovative interaction models. In particular, agents’ awareness, natural language understanding capability, and interaction ability are extended through the monitoring of user’s interaction with the IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) standard and the integration with IIIF compliant technologies. The scalability of the proposed solution is evaluated stressing the platform with simulated workloads.",

    "abstract": "Controlled vocabularies used in cultural heritage organizations (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums) are a helpful way to standardize terminology but can also result in misrepresentation or exclusion of systemically marginalized groups. Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) is one example of a widely used yet problematic controlled vocabulary for subject headings. In some cases, systemically marginalized groups are creating controlled vocabularies that better reflect their terminology. When a widely used vocabulary like LCSH and a controlled vocabulary from a marginalized community are both available as linked data, it is possible to incorporate the terminology from the marginalized community as an overlay or replacement for outdated or absent terms from more widely used vocabularies. This paper provides a use case for examining how the Homosaurus, an LGBTQ+ linked data controlled vocabulary, can provide an augmented and updated search experience to mitigate bias within a system that only uses LCSH for subject headings.",

When scaled to 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervision, the resulting models generalize well to standard benchmarks and are often competitive with prior fully supervised results but in a zero-shot transfer setting without the need for any fine-tuning. When compared to humans, the models approach their accuracy and robustness. We are releasing models and inference code to serve as a foundation for further work on robust speech processing.",

    "abstract": "The role and tasks of the library as an institution have considerably changed. Libraries are more and more regarded as powers that create and connect communities. The National Library of Estonia keeps that in mind when maintaining and establishing networks both as a humanities library as well as a social sciences and parliamentary library. Partnerships with libraries and memory institutions are especially important, as we are becoming a central service development institution for Estonian libraries.A great change has taken place in our way of thinking. The National Library of Estonia is no longer collection-centred, not only carrying out the mission to preserve cultural heritage, but is also human-centred, customer-centred. Our goals are to make collections available as much as possible, to address our users, and to provide an inspiring environment via the library space. The modern national library should indeed remind of a modern public library – the library of the whole nation. It is a place from where to draw inspiration, where to create and expose the creation, and where to hold discussions and debates.Today we offer a bulk of digital content as open data and the development of digital humanities services is in progress. Still we have to admit that the library’s role in teaching people how to use (open) data and how to support users with digital competencies should increase. Libraries are facing a never-ending work in developing the digital competences of their staff, who, in turn, will teach the library users, the citizens of e-governed state.The vision of the National Library of Estonia for the coming years is to be the library of a new generation and the developer of librarianship ideas by providing an open, inspiring, and participatory environment for activities. We have used a metaphor of a bridge while drawing up our new strategy. We aim to create a bridge between knowledge and people. A bridge that every new generation will build again and what will become ever more telling, significant and lasting by every generation.",

    "abstract": "The digitization of archival collections has become ubiquitous in the modern age. Contrary to the prevalence and popularity of these virtual collections, they are not without their limitations. Archivists have not sufficiently addressed the relationship between digital surrogates and their original objects. This article reviews a project undertaken by the authors who examined forty-two digitized archival collections from seven midwestern states. The study sought to determine whether digital surrogates include sufficient metadata to enable the viewer to understand that the virtual object is a representation of a physical object, that the physical object may be accessed, and that the physical object is part of a larger collection. The article concludes that the metadata fields used to describe digital surrogates vary across repositories, as well as within the institutions; and that very little metadata provides strong connections between the virtual images and the physical materials they represent. The authors conclude by providing recommendations for how archivists might improve the linkages between digital surrogates and their physical counterparts.",

    "abstract": "A key challenge for manufacturers today is efficiently producing and delivering products on time. Issues include demand for customized products, changes in orders, and equipment status change, complicating the decision-making process. A real-time digital representation of the manufacturing operation would help address these challenges. Recent technology advancements of smart sensors, IoT, and cloud computing make it possible to realize a \"digital twin\" of a manufacturing system or process. Digital twins or surrogates are data-driven virtual representations that replicate, connect, and synchronize the operation of a manufacturing system or process. They utilize dynamically collected data to track system behaviors, analyze performance, and help make decisions without interrupting production. In this paper, we define digital surrogate, explore their relationships to simulation, digital thread, artificial intelligence, and IoT. We identify the technology and standard requirements and challenges for implementing digital surrogates. A production planning case is used to exemplify the digital surrogate concept.",

    "abstract": "Manufacturing enterprises are facing the need to align themselves to the new information technologies (IT) and respond to the new challenges of variable market demand. One of the key enablers of this IT revolution toward Smart Manufacturing is the digital twin (DT). It embeds a “virtual” image of the reality constantly synchronized with the real operating scenario to provide sound information (knowledge model) to reality interpretation model to draw sound decisions. The paper aims at providing an up-to date picture of the main DT components, their features and interaction problems. The paper aims at clearly tracing the ongoing research and technical challenges in conceiving and building DTs as well, according to different application domains and related technologies. To this purpose, the main questions answered here are: “What is a Digital Twin?”; “Where is appropriate to use a Digital Twin?”; “When has a Digital Twin to be developed?”; “Why should a Digital Twin be used?”; “How to design and implement a Digital Twin?”; “What are the main challenges of implementing a Digital Twin?”. This study tries to answer to the previous questions funding on a wide systematic literature review of scientific research, tools, and technicalities in different application domains.",

    "abstract": "This talk outlines a vision for Common European Data Spaces, proposed by the European Commission, where FAIR principles (Wilkinson et al. 2016) and FAIR Digital Objects (FDOs) (De Smedt et al. 2020, Schwardmann 2020) can play a role in bringing together research infrastructures, data aggregators and other stakeholders working with curated objects in museums, herbaria, libraries and archives. The organisations and stakeholders involved represent a wide range of disciplines and data types including biodiversity, ecology, anthropology, archaeology, cultural history, digital storytelling, art conservation, and history of science among others (ICEDIG 2020, Ortolja-Baird and Nyhan 2021). The context and the history of the curated objects also span the natural sciences and cultural heritage domains (Nadim 2021, Weber 2021). Despite this heterogeneity, various common themes in the area of digital curation, open access, and data usage (Tasovac et al. 2020) appear where FDOs and Common European Data Spaces can be a useful venue for supporting the European Strategy for Data. In particular, FDOs, as an abstraction mechanism to structure and describe digital artefacts from a specific domain yet at the same time provide interoperability (De Smedt et al. 2020), can help realise the vision behind a common data space to “bring together relevant data infrastructures and governance frameworks in order to facilitate data pooling and sharing”bring together relevant data infrastructures and governance frameworks in order to facilitate data pooling and sharing (European Commission 2022:2). A May 2022 report on the challenges and opportunities of European Common Data Spaces highlights the following points:Open data holders have extensive experience in data publishing, metadata management, data quality, dataset discovery, data federation, as well as tried-and-tested standards (e.g. DCAT) and technologies. There seems to be very little knowledge/technology transfer from the open data community to the data spaces community, which is a missed opportunity. Data space implementations should not reinvent wheels that the open data community has already developed, tested, and used extensively.Whether the data is private, shared, or open, using data from multiple sources requires interoperability at several levels, from identifiers to vocabularies. The question of which data intermediaries will act as neutral agents to ensure interoperability is underexplored in the data space context. Public administrations, building on their experience of publishing open data, are best placed to take on such rolesOpen data holders have extensive experience in data publishing, metadata management, data quality, dataset discovery, data federation, as well as tried-and-tested standards (e.g. DCAT) and technologies.

The question of which data intermediaries will act as neutral agents to ensure interoperability is underexplored in the data space context. Public administrations, building on their experience of publishing open data, are best placed to take on such roles Building on previous conversations facilitated by DiSSCo, DARIAH, Europeana, and Archives Portal Europe Foundation, (Europeana Conference 2021, DARIAH Annual Event 2022), this talk will address the above points from the perspective of bringing together the domains of natural history museums, cultural heritage, and digital humanities. Within our collaboration, we have identified several common areas such as data discoverability, linking, and providing contextual information, which align with the goal of FDO implementation. DiSSCo and DARIAH as European infrastructures, on the one hand, and Europeana and Archives Portal as data aggregators, on the other hand, are involved in improving access to data and the researchers’ capacity to work with heterogeneous data sources. One of the biggest shared challenges across the diverse workflows in the arts and humanities and natural history domains is that the data curation processes form a natural continuum between a range of different actors working either in cultural heritage institutions or in academia. In reality, these different layers of curation, enrichment and analysis are separated by legal, institutional, infrastructural and even funding silos (as in many countries, these institutions belong to different ministries, and fall under different legislative frameworks). How can this continuum, from a scholarly point of view, be supported within common data space and FDO framework? At the same time, implementing a common data space requires not just interoperability but stewardship and strategy for sharing resources (Keller 2021). The data infrastructure and FAIR related activities explored in our collaboration are of strategic importance to help Europe and the rest of the world deal with important societal issues. Therefore, bringing this collaboration within the context of FDO provides an ideal avenue to explore potential data, policy, and implementation matters, in order to address the two gaps outlined above for Common Data Spaces. Furthermore, the ideas expressed in Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage (with Europeana as the core stakeholder) and Green Deal Data Spaces need further clarification concerning implementation planning and most importantly, how multiple commons would work together. With DARIAH coming from the humanities and DiSSCo from the natural sciences side, such collaborations and synergy should align with the Common Data Spaces vision. The philosophy and ideas behind data and digital commons are not new (Fuchs 2020, Kashwan et al. 2021). However, it is crucial to contextualise the implementation strategy and benefits within data intensive, multidisciplinary research and FAIR principles. Given that curated objects are informational resources for the researchers, but can also provide contexts, and make visible the relationships between artefacts, people, publications, organisations, provenance, and events, it is important to think of them as much more than just records in a database. Additionally, FDOs as the digital representations of the curated objects have the potential of fostering cross-disciplinary collaborations (such as between biology, history, art or anthropology) and of providing a wider lens for understanding materiality and the role of data (Ribes 2019). As interdisciplinarity and data-driven foci are gaining traction via applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, it is vital to understand what FDO adoption and implementation can contribute to common data spaces. We believe FDOs can be a successful foundation for Common European Data Spaces because they can can connect multiple commons – from Green Deal to Cultural Heritage – in order to drive forward the vision for interdisciplinary collaboration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract For tribes whose preservation values and mitigation strategies for managing cultural heritage are built on an ethic of avoidance and minimal disturbance, geophysical technologies can be key components of the research design. These technologies, most notably ground-penetrating radar, have been used with great success in identifying and evaluating the depth, extent, and composition of some of those resources for heritage research and management purposes, easing tensions when working with sensitive ancestral places. Additionally, research in archaeological geophysics has shifted from feature finding in order to excavate targets of interest to the recognition that geophysical survey can provide data and interpretations for whole sites and landscapes complementary to or beyond that of excavation, especially regarding the intactness and sensitivity of cultural heritage sites. This use of geophysics as a primary method for research rather than a precursor to archaeological research has empowered tribes with another tool to advocate for low-impact investigation of ancestral sites and landscapes that position tribes as pro-science. Geophysical technologies provide scientifically rigorous yet minimally impactful strategies for investigating heritage while satisfying the requirements of academic and compliance archaeology in ways that can also be culturally appropriate for a much broader spectrum of tribal cultural heritage under consideration. , Para algunas tribus cuyos valores de preservación y estrategias de mitigación para la gestión del patrimonio cultural tribal se basan en una ética de evitación y perturbación mínima, las tecnologías geofísicas han demostrado ser componentes clave del diseño de la investigación. Estas tecnologías, entre las que destaca el radar de penetración terrestre, se han utilizado con gran éxito para identificar y evaluar la profundidad, la extensión y la composición de algunos de esos recursos con fines de investigación y gestión del patrimonio, aliviando las tensiones cuando se trabaja con lugares ancestrales sensibles. Adicionalmente, el cambio en la geofísica arqueológica, que ha pasado de la búsqueda de rasgos para excavar objetivos de interés al reconocimiento de que la prospección geofísica puede proporcionar datos e interpretaciones de sitios y paisajes enteros complementarios o superiores a los de la excavación, especialmente en lo que respecta a la integridad y la sensibilidad de los sitios del patrimonio cultural, ha dotado a las tribus de otra herramienta para abogar por la investigación no destructiva y de bajo impacto de los sitios y paisajes ancestrales que sitúan a las tribus a favor de la ciencia. Las tecnologías geofísicas proporcionan estrategias científicamente rigurosas, pero de mínimo impacto para investigar el patrimonio en el paisaje, a la vez que satisfacen los requisitos de la arqueología académica, gestión de recursos culturales (CRM, por sus siglas en inglés) y de cumplimiento arqueológico, de manera que también pueden ser culturalmente apropiadas para abarcar un espectro mucho más amplio del patrimonio cultural tribal en consideración.",

    "abstract": "Digital curation, as represented through the digital content lifecycle model, involves the preservation, promotion, and long-term access to born-digital and digitized collections of heritage material, data, and publications supporting research with surviving (albeit considered obsolete), current, and emerging digital technologies. Social curation involves community and public feedback using various social media platforms; it aims to add meanings to collections and enrich public discourse on collection or exhibition themes. The definitions for curation, digital curation, digital preservation, and digital humanities data curation outline the scope of digital curation. There are multiple levels of curation, which vary by the institutional context, but this chapter emphasizes the principle that archives perform vital services to ensure accessibility to data used in digital humanities and sciences. This chapter focuses on digital curation as a practical framework for preserving and promoting cultural heritage collections, data, and other forms of digital content as well as discussing the various levels of curation aiming to preserve the quality and integrity of those collections and data. Although scholarly work in the digital humanities may extend beyond the physical archives, many projects will continue to use primary sources and data from archives and the digital repositories they maintain.",

    "abstract": "Dance serves an important role in the cultural lives of a people and transcends the overall aesthetics of the body to convey the cultural essence of the dance. Among the Abraka people, the emedjo dance is an art form that reflects their cultural beliefs and thus goes beyond mere aesthetic dancing. The foremost challenges to the survival of the emedjo dance are Christianity and Western influence and if not addressed, these can adversely affect the cultural potency of the dance and in turn the intrinsic cultural elements thereof. This paper, therefore, serves as an avenue to bring to the fore the social-cultural significance of the dance, using social-cultural material to illustrate the intrinsic nature of the dance, thereby preserving the cultural context thereof. To accomplish this, the researcher used a range of data gathering methods, including interviews, participant observation, and a review of related literature. Dunham’s conceptual and ethnographic theory was employed to gain an in-depth understanding of the social-cultural significance of the emedjo dance as both an observer and a participant observer during the dance performance. The study concludes that emedjo dance is an art form that can entertain, inform, and educate the Abraka people about the uniqueness of their cultural heritage and remind them of their cultural roots. The study, therefore, recommends that, for sustainability and continuity, the emedjo dance should not be limited to the dance performance alone but should also include the dance’s many artefacts. Such factors ensure the emedjo masquerade dance culture’s continuity and originality.Keywords: emedjo dance, masquerade, Abraka people, cultural dance, ceremonial dance.",

    "abstract": "Digital humanities has grown and changed over the years; we have moved away from expecting technology to be a tool to make humanities research easier and faster into one where we are now equal partners. Our collaborative projects drive forward the research agendas of both humanists and technologists. There have been other changes too. The focus of our scholarly interest has moved away from its historical origins in text-based scholarship, although that now has many more possibilities, and we are seeing an interest in exploring culture and heritage more widely. Where the progress is slower is in our moves towards openness and inclusivity, and this is to some extent hampered by a lack of linguistic diversity. This is being addressed with specialist groups within the major DH organizations on a national and a global level. DH has grown rapidly in China, and the anglophone world could do more to engage with practitioners and potential colleagues in this new vibrant and emerging area. There are certainly Western centres that specialize, particularly in Chinese texts and historical documents, but this needs to be extended further if we are not to impose limits on the conversations, synergies and collaborations that can result.",

    "abstract": "There is no clear-cut boundary between Free and Open Source Software and Open Scholarship, and the histories, practices, and fundamental principles between the two remain complex. In this study, we critically appraise the intersections and differences between the two movements. Based on our thematic comparison here, we conclude several key things. First, there is substantial scope for new communities of practice to form within scholarly communities that place sharing and collaboration/open participation at their focus. Second, Both the principles and practices of FOSS can be more deeply ingrained within scholarship, asserting a balance between pragmatism and social ideology. Third, at the present, Open Scholarship risks being subverted and compromised by commercial players. Fourth, the shift and acceleration towards a system of Open Scholarship will be greatly enhanced by a concurrent shift in recognising a broader range of practices and outputs beyond traditional peer review and research articles. In order to achieve this, we propose the formulation of a new type of institutional mandate. We believe that there is substantial need for research funders to invest in sustainable open scholarly infrastructure, and the communities that support them, to avoid the capture and enclosure of key research services that would prevent optimal researcher behaviours. Such a shift could ultimately lead to a healthier scientific culture, and a system where competition is replaced by collaboration, resources (including time and people) are shared and acknowledged more efficiently, and the research becomes inherently more rigorous, verified, and reproducible.",

    "abstract": "Information and Knowledge Organisation explores the role of knowledge organisation in the digital humanities. By focusing on how information is described, represented and organised in both research and practice, this work furthers the transdisciplinary nature of digital humanities.Including contributions from Asia, Australia, Europe, North America and the Middle East, the volume explores the potential uses of, and challenges involved in, applying the organisation of information and knowledge in the various areas of Digital Humanities. With a particular focus on the digital worlds of cultural heritage collections, the book also includes chapters that focus on machine learning, knowledge graphs, text analysis, text annotations and network analysis. Other topics covered include: semantic technologies, conceptual schemas and data augmentation, digital scholarly editing, metadata creation, browsing, visualisation and relevance ranking. Most importantly, perhaps, the book provides a starting point for discussions about the impact of information and knowledge organisation and related tools on the methodologies used in the Digital Humanities field.Information and Knowledge Organisation is intended for use by researchers, students and professionals interested in the role information and knowledge organisation plays in the Digital Humanities. It will be essential reading for those working in library and information science, computer science and across the humanities.   The Open Access version of this book, available at www.taylorfrancis.com, has been made available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives 4.0 license.",

    "abstract": "Katja Müller geht Fragen nach der Materialität digitaler Objekte nach, die Museumssammlungen und Archive mit besonderem Nachdruck aufwerfen. Besteht (weiterhin) eine Notwendigkeit zur Materialität von Kulturerbe? Haben hier entstandene digitale Objekte eine Materialität? Sind sie eigene Entitäten? Dieser Beitrag argumentiert auf der Basis theoretischer Überlegungen und analysiert aus ethnologischer Sicht die Praxis von Digitalisierung in Sammlungen und Archiven. Als Beispiel dienen die Staatlichen Museen zu Berlin. Es zeigt sich, dass digitale Objekte und Datenbanken durchaus als eigenständige Entitäten erscheinen. Sie sind Objekte performativer Materialität und definitionsabhängige Grenzgänger. Der vertraute Raum des Archivs oder Depots scheint digitalen Objekten zu eng und unbequem zu werden. Sie stellen uns vor neue Herausforderungen, die nicht nur ihre Nutzung und Verbreitung im digitalen Raum betreffen, sondern insbesondere auf unsere Vorstellungen von musealen Objekten abzielen. , Katja Müller addresses the question of materiality of digital objects, which museum collections and archives pose emphatically. Do we (continuously) need the materiality of cultural heritage? Do digital objects have a materiality? Are their own entities? This chapter argues on the basis of theoretical considerations and analyses in terms of social anthropology the practice of digitizing museum collections and archives. The Staatliche Museen zu Berlin serve as an example. It shows that digital objects and databases indeed appear as discrete entities. They are objects of performative materiality and definition dependent frontier runners. The familiar space of the depot seems too narrow and inconvenient for digital objects. Digitization entails new challenges regarding objects’ use and circulation in cyberspace, but especially with regards to our conceptions of museum objects.",

Mais une étape seulement, comme le démontre le dossier du numéro 4 de Documentaliste - Sciences de l’information. Car le chemin est encore long avant d’atteindre les fameuses « 5 étoiles » définies par Tim Berners-Lee, à savoir des données structurées, identifiées, dans un format non-propriétaire et liées entre elles sémantiquement. Vous inviter à rejoindre ce chemin, telle est l’ambition de ce dossier pour lequel nous avons rassemblé un vaste panel de spécialistes. Ces derniers abordent la question du web sémantique sous l’angle de la technique (« c’est quoi ? ») et des enjeux (« pour quoi faire ?). Et puisque la revue que vous tenez entre les mains s’appelle Documentaliste, il n’était évidemment pas envisageable de faire l’impasse sur les applications documentaires de ces nouveaux concepts.",

    "abstract": "This article explores the significance of the material practices of photography and its archiving in interpretive approaches to the relationship between photographs and history. Drawing on work in material culture studies in anthropology and on the concept of \"material hermeneutic,\" it argues that photographs should not be understood only through forensic and semiotic analysis of content, but as objects that constitute material performances of a complex range of historiographical desires in the negotiation of the relations among past, present, and future. The analysis is grounded in an exploration of the material practices of the photographic survey movement in England between 1885 and 1918. This loosely cohered group of amateur photographers recorded a historical topography of ancient churches, cottages, passing events, and folk customs in order to create a photographic record for the benefit of future generations. As such it was a self-conscious statement of \"popular historicism.\" The members’ concern for key values of permanence and accuracy, expressed through the detail of photographic and archival processes, reveals the ways in which cultural loss and photographic loss become mutually sustaining metaphors for each other, and in which the photographs themselves are material markers of both evidential value and of an affective historical imagination.",

    "abstract": "We here introduce the latest issue of Historical Social Research Supplement (No. 31). In “Models and Modelling between Digital and Humanities - A Multidisciplinary Perspective” we refrain from providing a normative definition of “model” and “modelling” and rather attempt at encircling the current state of the art. In the first instance this chapter provides a very brief overview on modelling as intended as a research strategy applied to scientific fields in the 20th-21st centuries. This overview is followed by a short introduction to modelling in digital humanities, focusing on how modelling has developed into a practical strategy and how it has been theorised. The third part of the introduction presents the scope of the project ”Modelling between digital and humanities: Thinking in practice”. The aim of a project workshop held in 2017, of which HSR Supplement 31 collects the proceedings, was to present a multitude of modelling practices from various disciplines together with different theoretical frameworks. The fourth part of this introduction offers an overview of each of the papers in that volume. Finally, a fifth section constitutes the first item of the proceedings as it reproduces an adaptation of the dialogue which was performed to introduce the main topics of the workshop and the scope of the project at the event itself. It serves to illustrate the way we organised the workshop and how the exchanges amongst participants were facilitated.",

    "abstract": "This article highlights the particular - embodied - ways in which the human record can be collected, organized, and preserved. Engaging both archival and queer theories, the understanding of body-as-archives and archives-as-body is instantiated in the oral history record from one genderqueer poet. This poet’s narration can be understood as a nomadic one of multiplicities, undoings, and metamorphoses. The far-reaching possibilities of the ongoing histories of the simultaneous becoming and unbecoming - archived (un)becomings - are at play and embodied throughout this archived oral history.  The archives can produce a dizzying effect through which, I argue, archivists can resist the urge to settle, to neatly organize, and to contain the archival records to consider new ways to understand and represent the dynamic (un)becomings. Through the interpretive frame of the nomadic, the archives can be understood as a site of (un)becomings and as a space that can hold moving living histories.",

    "abstract": "In this provocative analysis of historical narrative, Michel-Rolph Trouillot demonstrates how power operates, often invisibly, at all stages in the making of history to silence certain voices. From the West’s failure to acknowledge the Haitian Revolution, the most successful slave revolt in history, to the continued debate over denials of the Holocaust, and the meaning of Columbus’s arrival in the Americas, Trouillot shows us that history is not simply the recording of facts and events, but a process of actively enforced silences, some unconscious, others quite deliberate",

    "abstract": "Taking up the challenges of the datafication of culture, as well as of the scholarship of cultural inquiry itself, this collection contributes to the critical debate about data and algorithms. How can we understand the quality and significance of current socio-technical transformations that result from datafication and algorithmization? How can we explore the changing conditions and contours for living within such new and changing frameworks? How can, or should we, think and act within, but also in response to these conditions?This collection brings together various perspectives on the datafication and algorithmization of culture from debates and disciplines within the field of cultural inquiry, specifically (new) media studies, game studies, urban studies, screen studies, and gender and postcolonial studies. It proposes conceptual and methodological directions for exploring where, when, and how data and algorithms (re)shape cultural practices, create (in)justice, and (co)produce knowledge.",

    "abstract": "\"Today, anyone with an internet connection can access hundreds of millions of digitized cultural artifacts from the comfort of their desk. And every day cultural institutions and private bodies add thousands of new cultural works to the digital sphere. Mass digitization is forming new central nexuses of knowledge and new ways of engaging with that knowledge. What at first glance appears to be a simple act of digitization (a transformation of singular books from boundary objects to open sets of data), at closer examination reveals a complex process teeming with diverse political, legal, and cultural investments. This book argues that mass digitization has become a global cultural political project. It offers an in-depth examination of mass digitization of cultural memory in the West and beyond. It suggests a new approach to the study of digital cultural memory archives, proposing to understand mass digitization not as neutral technical processes, but rather as distinct subpolitical processes that build new kinds of archives and new ways of interacting with these archives. And it seeks to develop a critical theoretical framework for understanding the new archival apparatuses and the politics and memory dynamics they give rise to\"–",

    "abstract": "On Making in the Digital Humanities fills a gap in our understanding of digital humanities projects and craft by exploring the processes of making as much as the products that arise from it. The volume draws focus to the interwoven layers of human and technological textures that constitute digital humanities scholarship. To do this, it assembles a group of well-known, experienced and emerging scholars in the digital humanities to reflect on various forms of making (we privilege here the creative and applied side of the digital humanities). The volume honours the work of John Bradley, as it is totemic of a practice of making that is deeply informed by critical perspectives. A special chapter also honours the profound contributions that this volume’s co-editor, Stéfan Sinclair, made to the creative, applied and intellectual praxis of making and the digital humanities. Stéfan Sinclair passed away on 6 August 2020. The chapters gathered here are individually important, but together provide a very human view on what it is to do the digital humanities, in the past, present and future. This book will accordingly be of interest to researchers, teachers and students of the digital humanities; creative humanities, including maker spaces and culture; information studies; the history of computing and technology; and the history of science and the humanities.",

    "abstract": "Requirements engineering remains a discipline that is faced with a large number of challenges, including the implementation of a requirements elicitation process in industry. Although several proposals have been suggested by researchers and academics, little is known of the practices that are actually followed in industry. Our objective is to investigate the state-of-practice with respect to requirements elicitation, by closely examining practitioners’ current practices. To this aim, we focus on the techniques that are used in industry, the roles that requirements elicitation involves, and the challenges that the requirements elicitation process is faced with. As method, we conducted an interview-based survey study involving 24 practitioners from 12 different Swedish IT companies, and we recorded the interviews and analyzed these recordings by using quantitative and qualitative methods. Several results emerged from the studies. Group interaction techniques, including meetings and workshops, are the most popular type of elicitation techniques that are employed by the practitioners, except in the case of small projects. Additionally, practitioners tend to use a variety of elicitation techniques in each project. We noted that customers are frequently involved in the elicitation process, except in the case of market-driven organizations. Technical staff (for example, developers and architects) are more frequently involved in the elicitation process compared to the involvement of business or strategic staff. Finally, we identified a number of challenges with respect to stakeholders. These challenges include difficulties in understanding and prioritizing their needs. Further, it was noted that requirements instability (i.e., caused by changing needs or priorities) was a predominant challenge. These observations need to be interpreted in the context of the study. We conclude that the relevant observations regarding the survey participants’ experiences should be of interest to the industry; experiences that should be analyzed in the practitioners’ context. Researchers may find evidence for the use of academic results in practice, thereby inspiring future theoretical work, as well as further empirical studies in the same area.",

    "abstract": "Software development is the process of building systems that solve users’ need and satisfy stakeholders’ objectives. Such needs are determined through requirements elicitation, which is considered an intensive, complex, and multi-disciplinary process. Traditional methods of elicitation often fail to uncover requirements that are critical for successful and wide-scale user adoption because these methods primarily focus on the technical aspects and constraints of the systems rather than considering a socio-technical perspective. The success of information system development involves the identification of the social, organizational and technical features of the systems, which in turn can result in a more acceptable system by users. In this paper, we propose a requirements elicitation process based on socio-technical (ST) systems theory. The process leverages ST system components to help identify a set of ST imbalances, which in turn help in requirements elicitation. The applicability of the process is demonstrated using empirical investigation with a randomized two-group experimental design, where the objective is to see the potential of the proposed process to enhance analysts’ understanding of socio-technical aspects of a domain, interview readiness, and questionnaire quality.",

    "abstract": "How do the power dynamics of actors in digital knowledge production define the contours of global science and humanities? Where are scholars now in their efforts to improve a networked, global academic system based on the values of equal access to resources, inclusive participation, and the diversity of epistemologies? This article intervenes in these questions by discussing social dimensions of global knowledge infrastructure—connection, standardization, and access—to understand the specification and materialization of global digital humanities (DH). As digital practices expand across the world, the DH community struggles to ensure inclusive participation and equal opportunities in developing the field. This article shows that discrepancies in global DH lie at the root of existing infrastructure inequalities. Drawing on science and technology studies, it then argues that in order to overcome these imbalances, the academic community can seek the “infrastructuring” of DH. Infrastructuring is an analytical concept that shifts attention from “structure” to “process” of co-creation in the vein of participatory design that foregrounds public engagement, shared interest, and long-term relationships with stakeholders to create networks from which equal opportunities and new forms of connections can emerge. This would involve building an inclusive network of unique nodes of local communities on top of the global knowledge infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Over the past two decades, the European Commission has mobilised cultural heritage to bolster a European identity. One of the main flagship initiatives promoted to this end has been Europeana, the most extensive digital cultural project financed by the EU. At the core of the project stands europeana.eu, a digital cultural portal aggregating metadata provided by national and local heritage institutions. Central in our analysis is the Europeana Data Model (EDM). Using standardised thesauri and vocabularies, EDM offers the possibility to create a semantic contextualisation for objects, allowing semantic operations on the metadata and their enrichment with Linked Open Data on the web. Due to its overarching nature, EDM cannot deliver the granularity that cultural heritage institutions need when documenting their resources. Nonetheless, heritage institutions accept to sacrifice accuracy to have their information represented in a Europewide collection. We study how this digital heritage infrastructure was designed to enact a sense of Europeanness amongst national and local institutions. Policy documents, ethnographic research and a systematic survey amongst the European heritage institutions enabled us to trace how a standardised European metadata structure plays a role in governing local and national heritage institutions. The EDM might enable heritage stakeholders to benefit from Europeana’s online exposure while enacting a European mindset. Ultimately, this study of the metadata model enriches the debate on the EU’s cultural heritage politics, which has not fully explored the role of the digital. At the same time, it also taps into debates about infrastructure and digital governmentality.",

    "abstract": "Die Langzeitarchivierung von Forschungsdaten ist eine Voraussetzung für gute wissenschaftliche Praxis. Sie weist drei zentrale Bereiche auf: die Dokumentation der Forschungsdaten, deren langfristige Aufbewahrung sowie die Bereitstellung eines Zugangs zu den Daten. Ohne diese infrastrukturellen wie organisatorischen Voraussetzungen sind die Daten für die wissenschaftliche Sekundärnutzung, also für die Überprüfung von Ergebnissen und auch für die Beantwortung neuer Forschungsfragen nur eingeschränkt verfügbar. Das vorliegende Buch gibt einen Überblick über bestehende Standards und liefert einen Beitrag zur Diskussion über Voraussetzungen zur Archivierung von Datenbeständen. Es ist somit gleichermaßen für Infrastruktureinrichtungen, Fachbibliotheken, Archive, Wissenschaftler und alle, die im weitesten Sinne mit der Verfügbarmachung von Forschungsdaten betraut sind, lesenswert.

    "abstract": "Abstract Advancement of understanding in paleontology and biology has always been hindered by difficulty in accessing comparative data. With current and burgeoning technology, the severity of this hindrance can be substantially reduced. Researchers and museum personnel generating three-dimensional (3-D) digital models of museum specimens can archive them using internet repositories that can then be explored and utilized by other researchers and private individuals without a museum trip. We focus on MorphoSource, the largest web archive for 3-D museum data at present. We describe the site, how to use it most effectively in its current form, and best practices for file formats and metadata inclusion to aid the growing community wishing to utilize it for distributing 3-D digital data. The potential rewards of successfully crowd sourcing the digitization of museum collections from the research community are great, as it should ensure rapid availability of the most important datasets. Challenges include long-term governance (i.e., maintaining site functionality, supporting large amounts of digital storage, and monitoring/updating file to prevent bit rot, which is the slow and random corruption of electronic data over time, and data format obsolescence, which is the problem of data becoming unreadable or ineffective because of the loss of functional software necessary for access), and utilization by the community (i.e., detecting and minimizing user error in creating data records, incentivizing data sharing by researchers and institutions alike, and protecting stakeholder rights to data, while maximizing accessibility and discoverability). MorphoSource serves as a proof-of-concept of how these kinds of challenges can be met. Accordingly, it is generally recognized as the most appropriate repository for large, raw datasets of fossil organisms and/or comparative samples. Its existence has begun to transform data transparency standards because journal reviewers, editors, and grant officers now often suggest or require that 3-D data be made available through this site.",

    "abstract": "In this article we describe the possibilities and opportunities of the utilization of 3D georeferenced historical images in different contexts. In the frame of an ongoing research project that aims at establishing a national infrastructure for georeferenced pictures, we have created an open API that allows researchers and developers to access and interact with an existing database containing 200’000 3D-georeferenced images. In this database images have been georeferenced by volunteers in 3D using monoplotting. The new API allows for instance to extract the 3D geolocation of images and their footprints as well as to upload new images. It is as far as possible based on existing standards in the fields of archive management, 3D image standards and web-services. This work is of interest for researchers who want to utilize and analyze 3D georeferenced historical imagery and for people who want to establish open API’s to give access to data that is relevant for research.",

    "abstract": "Cultural heritage is increasingly put through imaging systems such as multispectral cameras and 3D scanners. Though these acquisition systems are often used independently, they collect complementary information (spectral vs. spatial) used for the study, archiving and visualization of cultural heritage. Recording 3D and multispectral data in a single coordinate system enhances the potential insights in data analysis. We present the state of the art of such acquisition systems and their applications for the study of cultural heritage. We also describe existing registration techniques that can be used to obtain 3D models with multispectral texture and explore the idea of optically tracking acquisition systems to ensure an easy and precise registration.",

    "abstract": "The Swiss National Data & Service Center for the Humanities (DaSCH), a IIIF-C full member since 2017 has implemented the Simple Image Presentation Interface (SIPI), a IIIF Image API 3.0 Server that DaSCH maintained with the help of the Digital Humanities Lab of the University of Basel, within the DaSCH Service Platform (DSP), a software framework used for storing, sharing, and working with primary sources and data in the humanities. DaSCH is in the process of designing a proof-of-concept for the deployment of the IIIF Presentation API 3.0 and the IIIF Change Discovery API 1.0, on the basis of the existing resources and projects hosted on DSP. For the Presentation API, templates will be first created manually with the help of the cookbook recipes. Then, scripts enabling the semi-automation for generating IIIF resources will be designed. As for the Change Discovery, DaSCH already provides an Event log of created resources. Thus an assessment on how the ActivityStreams endpoint could be built on top of it will be carried out. The lightning talk will explore the process and challenges involved in deploying these IIIF APIs and how they could be implemented within DSP to allow users to further contextualise cultural heritage resources on and off the platform as well as enabling improved aggregation thereof.

    "abstract": "In this highly original work, Pierre Bourdieu turns his attention to the academic world of which he is part and offers a brilliant analysis of modern intellectual culture. The academy is shown to be not just a realm of dialogue and debate, but also a sphere of power in which reputations and careers are made, defended and destroyed.Employing the distinctive methods for which he has become well known, Bourdieu examines the social background and practical activities of his fellow academics—from Foucault, Derrida, and Lacan to figures who are lesser known but not necessarily less influential. Bourdieu analyzes their social origins and current positions, how much they publish and where they publish it, their institutional connections, media appearances, political involvements and so on. This enables Bourdieu to construct a map of the intellectual field in France and to analyze the forms of capital and power, the lines of conflict and the patterns of change, which characterize the system of higher education in France today.Homo Academicus paints a vivid and dynamic picture of French intellectual life today and develops a general approach to the study of modern culture and education. It will be of great interest to students of sociology, education and politics as well as to anyone concerned with the role of intellectuals and higher education today.",

    "abstract": "\"This provocative new introduction to the field of digital sociology offers a critical overview of interdisciplinary debates about new ways of knowing society that are emerging today at the interface of computing, social research and social life. Digital Sociology introduces key concepts, methods and understandings that currently inform the development of specifically digital forms of social inquiry. Marres assesses the relevance and usefulness of digital methods, data and techniques for the study of sociological phenomena and evaluates the major claim that computation makes possible a new ?science of society?. As Marres argues, the digital does much more than inspire innovation in social research ? it forces us to engage anew with fundamental sociological questions. If digital ways of knowing society are to deliver on their promise, we must learn to appreciate that the digital has the capacity to throw into crisis existing knowledge frameworks and is likely to reconfigure wider relations between sociology, computing, media and their publics. This timely engagement with a key transformation of our times will be indispensable reading for undergraduate and graduate students taking courses in digital sociology, digital media, computing and society\"–",

    "abstract": "Digital Methods can be defined as the repurposing of the inscriptions generated by digital media for the study of collective phenomena. The strength of these methods comes from their capacity to take advantage of the data and computational capacities of online platforms; their weakness comes from the difficulty to separate the phenomena that they investigate from the features of the media in which they manifest (?the medium is the message?, according to McLuhan?s 1964 dictum). In this article, we discuss various methodological difficulties deriving from the lack of separation between medium and message and propose eight practical precautions to deal with it.",

    "abstract": "Open Science is a disruptive phenomenon that is emerging around the world and especially in Europe. Open Science brings about socio-cultural and technological change, based on openness and connectivity, on how research is designed, performed, captured, and assessed. Several studies show that there is a lack of awareness about what Open Science is, mainly due to the fact that there is no formal definition of Open Science. The purpose of this paper is to build a rigorous, integrated, and up-to-date definition of the Open Science phenomenon through a systematic literature review. The resulting definition “Open Science is transparent and accessible knowledge that is shared and developed through collaborative networks” helps the scientific community, the business world, political actors, and citizens to have a common and clear understanding about what Open Science is, and stimulates an open debate about the social, economic, and human added value of this phenomenon.",

In such an environment, characterized by large distributed, autonomous, diverse, and dynamic information sources, access to relevant and accurate information is becoming increasingly complex. This complexity is exacerbated by the evolving system, semantic and structural heterogeneity of these potentially global, cross-disciplinary, multicultural and rich-media technologies. Clearly, solutions to these challenges require addressing directly a variety of interoperability issues.",

As the Médialab mostly used web topologies as structural analysis of social positions, they were not able to account for the propagation of ideas, considered in actor network theory as non-humans that have their own agency. The main arguments in favour of the ?more continuous social? developed at the Médialab (quali-quanti, following the actors, zooming) proved to be as misleading as the network metaphor. The distribution of agency that actor network theory so successfully expands was paradoxicallty reduced to structures and individual preferences, to the detriment of the agency of replications that circulate entities in the form of messages, content or memes, and that should now become the next step for actor network theory-style digital methods.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this article is to examine the potential of Actor–Network Theory as a nonhuman social science theory through critical readings of Bruno Latour’s empirical studies. In previous studies on ANT, an important issue has been to categorize it in regard to the type of theory it represents. Following Latour’s description of ANT as an “infra-theory” or “infra-language,” this article deals with the question of the relationship of those two terms to ANT. To examine these concepts, we will review two of Latour’s case studies: the historical study on Louis Pasteur’s eradication of anthrax and the ethnography on the failure of the automated train operation system of the Paris metro. After exploring these cases, we conclude that ANT is a theory not for causal explanation but for the discovery of hidden factors.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThe purpose of this research was to explore the conceptual network of live online education efficiency from the Actor Network Theory perspective to reveal different aspects influencing the quality of online training less accounted for in previous research.MethodologyActor Network Theory was used to analyse the qualitative feedback from 100 live online education sessions. Responses from 90 educators and 556 participants were coded into enablers and inhibitors of education quality and further clustered into different actors that might mediate learning success.FindingsThe key finding of this research is a visual representation of the complex network of actors potentially affecting live online education quality, revealing the interplay of non-human aspects (e.g., hardware, software, session design, and descriptions), as well as human elements (participants and their expectations, educators and their emotional reactions attributed to different actors of the network, organisers, and external mentors/experts).LimitationsThe piloting qualitative research was conducted within the framework of one educational event, where participants opted in voluntarily to attend and participate in the study. It is a specific educational context different from workplace training and other non-formal education.Practical ImplicationsLearning and development practitioners can find 10 recommendations designed to support the instructional design and delivery of their (online) sessions based on the collective experiences of the study participants and authors.Originality/valueIt is the first research in the field of live online education, acknowledging and mapping the role of multiple actors posited to play an influential role in the overall quality. It also calls for a transition from “content-focused and controlling” to “contextually-aware and responsive” educator in future research.",

    "abstract": "Subconsciously, experienced teachers make use of situated knowledge: knowledge that is connected to, and arises from, the interactions between the physical environment where the action takes place and a material body acting in that environment. Since situated knowledge is important in day-to-day teaching to solve incidents, it should be taught in teacher training courses. Consequently, in the test at the end of such a course, these learning objectives should be tested. By using cases and by setting higher learning objectives that explicitly address the situated nature of this knowledge, situated knowledge can be assessed. In this study, the main question is: Do teacher trainers use cases that are aimed at acquiring situated knowledge? An empirical study, carried out in eleven secondary teacher-training programs in the Netherlands, revealed that just a single program did indeed assess situated knowledge. Considering its importance, however, it is essential that it is included in all secondary teacher-training programs. To assist teacher training programs to achieve this goal, this article offers recommendations for implementing tests with cases to assess situated knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Purpose This paper considers the role of nonhuman animals in the thought of Donna Haraway, going from her critique of the animal as model/mirror for the evolution of the human body politic to her proposal for a “compost” society. It demonstrates her changing positions in relation to the social role of animals and the deepening of her critique of intersectional relations that subordinate nonhuman animals and animalized people. Design/methodology/approach The paper intertwines a loosely historical approach and a thematic one, focusing on key issues of sociological theory, such as work, agency and kinship, and the way these relate to the animal question in Haraway’s writings. Her texts are discussed both broadly and in-depth, and her positionality in terms of both feminism and antispeciesism is foregrounded. Findings The paper shows how the progressive abandonment of a posthuman approach in favor of a compostist one brings Haraway nearer to intersectional ecofeminism and to a fuller consideration of nonhuman agency at a material level, as well as to a deeper critique of instrumental relations of domination and issue that had been problematic in critiques of her earlier work. Social implications The paper highlights the role of nonhumans in the evolution and constitution of societies and advocates a response-able multispecies politics. Originality/value This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the social role of animals in Haraway’s thought and the deepening antispeciesism of her feminist approach that sheds a different light on her positionality in relation to ecofeminism.",

    "abstract": "To support the sharing and reuse of formally represented knowledge among AI systems, it is useful to define the common vocabulary in which shared knowledge is represented. A specification of a representational vocabulary for a shared domain of discourse—definitions of classes, relations, functions, and other objects—is called an ontology. This paper describes a mechanism for defining ontologies that are portable over representation systems. Definitions written in a standard format for predicate calculus are translated by a system called Ontolingua into specialized representations, including frame-based systems as well as relational languages. This allows researchers to share and reuse ontologies, while retaining the computational benefits of specialized implementations. We discuss how the translation approach to portability addresses several technical problems. One problem is how to accommodate the stylistic and organizational differences among representations while preserving declarative content. Another is how to translate from a very expressive language into restricted languages, remaining system-independent while preserving the computational efficiency of implemented systems. We describe how these problems are addressed by basing Ontolingua itself on an ontology of domain-independent, representational idioms.",

    "abstract": "Bruno Latour has had a tremendous impact on the field of science studies. Yet, it is not always easy to say what he stands for. Indeed, Latour has often claimed that his work lacks any overall unity. In this essay, I suggest that at least one concept remains constant throughout Latour’s diverse studies of modern science and technology, namely, mediation. I try to make good this claim by focussing on Latour’s numerous attempts over the years to distance himself from, so as to discredit, the philosopher Martin Heidegger. I argue that Latour’s repeated denunciations of Heidegger amount to a systematic tactic of dissimulation: by suppressing the substance of Heidegger’s critique of modern technoscience, Latour directs attention away from the not insignificant weaknesses in his own theory of mediation. Against the backdrop of an appropriately reconstructed Heidegger, Latour’s self-promotion as a radically progressive non-modern thinker cannot be sustained.",

    "abstract": "The RDF graph-based data model has seen ever-broadening adoption in recent years, prompting the standardization of the SPARQL query language for RDF, and the development of local and distributed engines for processing SPARQL queries. This survey paper provides a comprehensive review of techniques, engines and benchmarks for querying RDF knowledge graphs. While other reviews on this topic tend to focus on the distributed setting, the main focus of the work is on providing a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art storage, indexing and query processing techniques for efficiently evaluating SPARQL queries in a local setting (on one machine). To keep the survey self-contained, we also provide a short discussion on graph partitioning techniques used in the distributed setting. We conclude by discussing contemporary research challenges for further improving SPARQL query engines. An online extended version also provides a survey of over one hundred SPARQL query engines and the techniques they use, along with twelve benchmarks and their features.",

    "abstract": "Co-authored by a Computer Scientist and a Digital Humanist, this article examines the challenges faced by cultural heritage institutions in the digital age, which have led to the closure of the vast majority of born-digital archival collections. It focuses particularly on cultural organizations such as libraries, museums and archives, used by historians, literary scholars and other Humanities scholars. Most born-digital records held by cultural organizations are inaccessible due to privacy, copyright, commercial and technical issues. Even when born-digital data are publicly available (as in the case of web archives), users often need to physically travel to repositories such as the British Library or the Bibliothèque Nationale de France to consult web pages. Provided with enough sample data from which to learn and train their models, AI, and more specifically machine learning algorithms, offer the opportunity to improve and ease the access to digital archives by learning to perform complex human tasks. These vary from providing intelligent support for searching the archives to automate tedious and time-consuming tasks.  In this article, we focus on sensitivity review as a practical solution to unlock digital archives that would allow archival institutions to make non-sensitive information available. This promise to make archives more accessible does not come free of warnings for potential pitfalls and risks: inherent errors, \"black box\" approaches that make the algorithm inscrutable, and risks related to bias, fake, or partial information. Our central argument is that AI can deliver its promise to make digital archival collections more accessible, but it also creates new challenges - particularly in terms of ethics. In the conclusion, we insist on the importance of fairness, accountability and transparency in the process of making digital archives more accessible.",

    "abstract": "Appraisal is one of the most significant aspects of contemporary archival science: it is its “noble function,” its central core. The author defines appraisal as “the act of judging the primary and secondary value of records and establishing the length of time during which they retain this value, within a context that respects the essential link between a given institution (or person) and the records they created in the course of their activities.” He then presents a comprehensive review of appraisal, defines the related issues and the place it occupies within the archival mission, and proposes five principles that govern the appraisal process. The author concludes by affirming that solid theoretical foundations exist to support records appraisal. RÉSUMÉL’évaluation est une des spécificités les plus marquantes de l’archivistique contemporaine : elle en est la fonction noble et le nœud dur.

    "abstract": "Archivists of private fonds often blame the absence of private archives from our professional literature on Sir Hilary Jenkinson and T.R. Schellenberg, whose influential works cast archival theory in English in the mould of the archives of national governments. But a careful reading of Jenkinson and Schellenberg shows that they said much about private archives and, in effect, denied archival status or character to what was called, in their day, historical manuscripts. In drawing a clear their ideas about private archives, its relationship to government archives, and the applicability of their concepts of authenticity, evidence, and value to private archives. Though some of their ideas have not aged well over the intervening years, many of the characteristics of private archives that troubled them still reverberate in the Canadian archival community today, with our present emphasis on accountability and heritage. The article concludes that their thinking about private archives still offers a starting point today for the further development of the theory of private archives. RÉSUMÉ Les archivistes de fonds privés ont souvent blâmé Sir Hilary Jenkinson et T. R. Schellenberg, dont les oeuvres influentes ont circonscrit la théorie archivistique de langue anglaise aux archives de gouvernements nationaux, d’avoir exclu les archives privées de notre littérature professionnelle. Cependant, une lecture attentive de Jenkinson et de Schellenberg révèle qu’ils ont beaucoup écrit au sujet des archives privées et, qu’en effet, ils ont nié le statut ou le caractère archivistique de ce que l’on appelait à l’époque des manuscrits historiques. En faisant une distinction claire entre les documents d’archives et les manuscrits, ils ont contribué – peut-être sans le vouloir – à la définition des caractéristiques théoriques des archives privées. Cet article examine leurs idées par rapport aux archives privées, la relation entre les archives privées et gouvernementales, ainsi que l’applicabilité aux archives privées de leurs concepts d’authenticité, de preuve et de valeur. Même si certaines de leurs idées paraissent maintenant démodées, plusieurs caractéristiques des archives privées qu’ils considéraient problématiques à l’époque continuent aujourd’hui de résonner dans la communauté archivistique canadienne, avec l’accent que nous plaçons actuellement sur l’obligation de rendre compte et le patrimoine. Cet article conclut que leurs idées au sujet des archives privées offrent encore aujourd’hui un point de départ pour le développement continu d’une théorie des archives privées.",

    "abstract": "Abstract At the core of museum practice is the notion of diversity. However, as this analysis of different types of metadata production shows, contradictory ideas and ideals pervade both metadata production among information specialists (i.e. archivists, metadata managers, curators working in the heritage institutions), and the systems for, and practices of, participatory metadata production. While the discourse on metadata standards is permeated by ideas of objectivity and interoperability the field is, in practice, far from coherent, being marked by a great variety as regards templates, formats and vocabularies. Conversely, the discourse on digital participation in the cultural heritage is permeated with notions of diversity, as means to increase democracy and support variety. In practice, however, the available crowdsourcing platforms are often formulaic offering few possibilities for the crowd to add individual interpretations and their own agenda. This analysis of the practice of producing descriptive metadata reveals the complex, multifaceted implications of notions of diversity for the cultural heritage. Diversity, meaning great variety, is then not solely a positive end in itself but can in fact hinder the distribution and linkability of information and thereby the creation and building of new knowledge. Likewise, participatory activities where heritage institutions reach out to the crowd do not automatically generate diversity as there is no direct correlation between the magnitude of the group and variability. To understand this complexity and acknowledge the, sometimes, contradictory demands and effects related to the notion and norms of diversity is at the core of the making and preservation of our cultural heritage.",

As it begins, William Ewell, a twenty-four-year-old Black man, is seen kneeling on a street corner in Hawthorne, California, with his hands behind his head. Behind him are a cluster of police cars and armed police officers. At least five of the officers are sheltered behind the open doors of the police cars, pointing their guns at Ewell. The videographer, Sky Holsey, introduces the scene to her viewers, panning across the intersection and pointing out the officers and their guns. She then tries to de-escalate the",

As Appiah recounts, the refrain, “I just want to see someone like me” represented in mainstream visual culture is a commonly uttered—if not entirely cliché—retort, so often recited by entertainers of color when asked why they do what they do: The playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney, explaining what drove him",

Once uploaded to PCs and other gadgets, photographs may be stored, deleted, put in albums, sent to relatives and friends, retouched, or put on display. Moreover, in recent years family photographs are more frequently appearing in public media: on posters, in newspapers and on the Internet, particularly in the wake of disasters like 9/11, and in cases of missing children. Here, case study material drawn from the UK offers a deeper understanding of both domestic family photographs and their public display. Recent work in material culture studies, geography, and anthropology is used to approach photographs as objects embedded in social practices, which produce specific social positions, relations and effects.

    "abstract": "Among the most widespread orthodoxies about photography concerns the intensity of its reach.¹ The notion is both simple and all-encompassing. With the rise of smartphones and social media, the feedback loop of taking and sharing photographs has reached an omnipresent fever pitch. With more photographs produced every two minutes than were produced in the entire 19th century—although this comparison is likely outdated—the institution of photography has begun to pervade every dimension of social and political life.² Whereas cameras and photos once enjoyed only partial distribution, now they enjoy a total distribution. In sum, or so this line of",

    "abstract": "We tend to equate the idea of ubiquitous photography with the digital, the internet, and the smartphone.¹ But the spread of photography into everyday life has happened in steps and phases ever since the invention of the carte-de-visite photograph in 1854, when portraiture became an integrated part of middle-class family life, identity formation, and the interchange and negotiation of social relations.² A major leap in terms of the production, consumption, and pervasiveness of ubiquitous everyday photography took place in the 1970s alongside the rapid development and expansion of capitalist welfare and consumer society in the Western world and concomitant technological",

They are thought to have taken over a quarter of a million photographs of houses, from Bundaberg to Beenleigh. Around two-thirds of the photographs were sold to householders, and the remaining 61,000 images were donated to State Library in 1995.

Les diverses organisations qui ont mis à profit ces spécifications, autant des solutions techniques que sociales, ont largement contribué à la valorisation des données du patrimoine cutlurel et ont ouvert de nouvelles possibilités aux utilisateurs, en particulier en répondant aussi bien aux besoins de la communauté scientifique qu’à ceux des développeurs de logiciels. A titre d’exemple, le projet de recherche « Pratiques de connaissance participatives dans les archives d’images analogiques et numériques » (PIA) est présenté. Celui-ci souhaite tirer parti de IIIF, WADM et Linked Art au sein du modèle de données dans le cadre d’une initiative de science citoyenne axée sur trois collections des archives photographiques de la société suisse des traditions populaires (SSTP). Grâce à ce socle technologique mettant en pratique le LOUD, PIA permettra ainsi une utilisation participative des archives offrant des possibilités aux différents publics cibles de contextualiser, relier, contraster et annoter les images et leurs métadonnées associées.",

    "abstract": "This photo shows my family home! How to make annotations of cultural heritage objects more accessible through IIIF The photo archive of the Swiss Society for Folklore Studies (SSFS) contains images on topics of everyday life, tradition and identity, forms of work and living, ranging in date from the late 19th century through the later part of the 20th century. Since the digitised photographic collections became available online in 2018, people knowledgeable about the archives’ resources have come forward. Identifying people in historical photographs is important for preserving material culture but it is also a challenging endeavour. Users may still be able to identify archival material but sound ecosystems to facilitate online annotation of digital surrogates are lacking and thus users have to fall back on more traditional means of communication, such as email. Annotations with IIIF makes it easier to add context and commentary to cultural heritage objects in an interoperable manner. This ten-minute lightning session will cover how image annotations work with IIIF and how users can leverage it to identify people in historical image collections. Particular attention is paid to the artefactual nature of photography such as handwritten information, texture, colour as well as possible damages that can assist in the process of dating and identifying. How do we analyse or evaluate this kind of image information? What new interpretations emerge when users are able to annotate digital surrogates of photographs? We suggest an interdisciplinary perspective in the context of the Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA) - https://about.participatory-archives.ch/ - that is useful for analysing the existing software and making annotations of historical photography accessible.

    "abstract": "PAGODE is a new project started on the 1st of April 2020, which proposes a thematic approach for aggregation, curation and presentation of Chinese cultural content hosted in European museums and Cultural Heritage Institutions (CHIs). The project aims to offer an innovative experience by making this content available in Europeana, the European digital library. PAGODE will aggregate to Europeana more than 10,000 newly digitised objects, annotate more than 2,000 digital objects that are already in Europeana, enrich automatically the metadata of more than 20,000 records, and activate a wide range of CHIs to plan new digitization and curation of relevant content from their collections. Focusing on the various forms of the presence of Chinese culture in Europe, the overall objective of PAGODE is to add further value to CHIs that own Chinese collections, to reach new end users, and to encourage creative use and reuse of cultural content in the domains of multicultural integration, cultural tourism, education and research.",

    "abstract": "Cultural heritage (CH) preservation and management play vital roles in conserving valuable properties and facilitating relevant historical studies on a country. The advanced technologies developed for CH preservation and management in recent years have made CH digitalization and documentation easy and have generated tremendous amounts of data for a wide range of applications. However, a great focus remains on the large amount of CH data, particularly on CH semantic interoperability, because various standards or schemas are applied during data generation. To achieve 3D CH semantic interoperability, this study proposes and comprehensively discusses an ontology-based approach for 3D tangible CH that includes 3D models, metadata, and their restoration information in the entire life cycle of the building information model (BIM). A tangible cultural heritage ontology is developed based on a top-level ontology, namely, the CIDOC conceptual reference model (CRM), for heritage information, metadata, and restoration. Access is achieved by mapping from the designated heritage in the national cultural heritage database with DC-based metadata to CIDOC CRM and from an enriched Heritage BIM with restoration information encoded as industry foundation classes (IFC) ontology to CIDOC CRM. The proposed framework can successfully combine a 3D model and its enriched information and is available for 3D model semantic accessing and integration. We focus on the discussion of Taiwan’s traditional Southern Fujian architecture.",

    "abstract": "To conform to FAIR principles, data should be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. Whereas tools exist for making data findable and accessible, interoperability is not straightforward and can limit data reusability. Most interoperability-based solutions address semantic description and metadata linkage, but these alone are not sufficient for the requirements of inter-comparison of population-based cancer data, where strict adherence to data-rules is of paramount importance. Ontologies, and more importantly their formalism in description logics, can play a key role in the automation of data-harmonization processes predominantly via the formalization of the data validation rules within the data-domain model. This in turn leads to a potential quality metric allowing users or agents to determine the limitations in the interpretation and comparability of the data. An approach is described for cancer-registry data with practical examples of how the validation rules can be modeled with description logic. Conformance of data to the rules can be quantified to provide metrics for several quality dimensions. Integrating these with metrics derived for other quality dimensions using tools such as data-shape languages and data-completion tests builds up a data-quality context to serve as an additional component in the FAIR digital object to support interoperability in the wider sense.",

Funding OSS development requires intentional focus on issues of scholarly credit, unique forms of labor, maintenance, governance, and inclusive community-building.

Here we present 10 simple rules for investing in scientific OSS and the teams who build and maintain it.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Surprise Machines is a project of experimental museology that sets out to visualize the entire image collection of the Harvard Art Museums, with a view to opening up unexpected vistas on more than 200,000 objects usually inaccessible to visitors. The project is part of the exhibition organized by metaLAB (at) Harvard entitled Curatorial A(i)gents and explores the limits of artificial intelligence to display a large set of images and create surprise among visitors. To achieve this feeling of surprise, a choreographic interface was designed to connect the audience’s movement with several unique views of the collection.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a visualization technique designed to uncover iconographic patterns prevalent within a collection while at the same time allowing close viewing of these particular details. Challenging an institutionalized understanding of overview and detail as inherently opposed, the intention of this research is to develop a visualization method that accounts for the iconographic abundance of a collection and encourages its casual exploration. Expanding digitization efforts have led to a growing number of rich cultural heritage datasets that are successively being published online. At the same time scholars are exploring the potential of computational methods to expand the scale and scope of art history. In this context, data visualization is often equated with a distanced perspective diminishing the intricate and intriguing details of individual artifacts. In collaboration with a museum of applied and decorative arts, we have devised a novel interface concept for the exploration of image collections such as historical glass plate negatives. Inspired by photographic plates on a light table, the resulting Close-up Cloud translates the art historical method of close viewing into the digital by combining it with a dynamic representation of quantitative iconographic patterns across an entire image collection.",

    "abstract": "The Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAM) sector deals with complex and varied data. Integrating that data, especially across institutions, has always been a challenge. Semantic data integration is the best approach to deal with such challenges. Linked Open Data (LOD) enable large-scale Digital Humanities (DH) research, collaboration and aggregation, allowing DH researchers to make connections between (and make sense of) the multitude of digitized Cultural Heritage (CH) available on the web. An upsurge of interest in semtech and LOD has swept the CH and DH communities. An active Linked Open Data for Libraries, Archives and Museums (LODLAM) community exists, CH data is published as LOD, and international collaborations have emerged. The value of LOD is especially high in the GLAM sector, since culture by its very nature is cross-border and interlinked. We present interesting LODLAM projects, datasets, and ontologies, as well as Ontotext’s experience in this domain. An extended version of this paper is available. It has 77 pages, 67 figures, detailed info about CH content and XML standards, Wikidata and global authority control.",

    "abstract": "In the World Wide Web, a very large number of resources are made available through digital libraries. The existence of many individual digital libraries, maintained by different organizations, brings challenges to the discoverability and usage of these resources by potential users. A widely-used approach is metadata aggregation, where a central organization takes the role of facilitating the discoverability and use of the resources, by collecting their associated metadata. The central organization has the possibility to further promote the usage of the resources by means that cannot be efficiently undertaken by each digital library in isolation. This paper focuses in the domain of cultural heritage, where OAI-PMH has been the embraced solution, since discovery of resources was only feasible if based on metadata instead of full-text. However, the technological landscape has changed. Nowadays, with the technological improvements accomplished by network communications, computational capacity, and Internet search engines, the motivation for adopting OAI-PMH is not as clear as it used to be. In this paper, we present the results of our analysis of available potential technologies, using as application context the Europeana Network and its requirements for metadata aggregation. We cover the following technologies: IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework); Webmention; Linked Data Notifications; WebSub; Sitemaps; ResourceSync; Open Publication Distribution System (OPDS); Linked Data Platform; and Schema.org.",

    "abstract": "Since the 1980s the concept of ANT has remained unsettled. ANT has continuously been critiqued and hailed, ridiculed and praised. It is still an open question whether ANT should be considered a theory or a method or whether ANT is better understood as entailing the dissolution of such modern \"genres\". In this paper the authors engage with some important reflections by John Law and Bruno Latour in order to analyze what it means to \"do ANT,\" and (even worse), doing so after \"doing ANT on ANT.\" In particular the authors examine two post-ANT case studies by Annemarie Mol and Marilyn Strathern and outline the notions of complexity, multiplicity, and fractality. The purpose is to illustrate the analytical consequences of thinking with post-ANT. The analysis offers insights into how it is possible to \"go beyond ANT,\" without leaving it entirely behind.",

    "abstract": "Scientific work is heterogeneous, requiring many different actors and viewpoints. It also requires cooperation. The two create tension between divergent viewpoints and the need for generalizable findings. We present a model of how one group of actors managed this tension. It draws on the work of amateurs, professionals, administrators and others connected to the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at the University of California, Berkeley, during its early years. Extending the Latour-Callon model of interessement, two major activities are central for translating between viewpoints: standardization of methods, and the development of ’boundary objects’. Boundary objects are both adaptable to different viewpoints and robust enough to maintain identity across them. We distinguish four types of boundary objects: repositories, ideal types, coincident boundaries and standardized forms.",

    "abstract": "The paper presents the Distributed Text Service API Specification, a community-built effort to facilitate the publication and consumption of texts and their structures as Linked Data. DTS was designed to be as generic as possible, providing simple operations for navigating collections, navigating within a text and retrieving textual content. While the DTS API uses JSON-LD as the serialization format for non-textual data (e.g. descriptive metadata), TEI XML was chosen as the minimum required format for textual data served by the API, in order to guarantee the interoperability of data published by DTS-compliant repositories. The paper describes the DTS API specifications by means of real-world examples, discusses the key design choices that were made, and concludes by providing a list of existing repositories and libraries that support DTS.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION. The use of actor-network theory is becoming increasingly common amongst information systems researchers. This study argues that the utility of actor-network theory as a conceptual tool for information systems research can be increased by expressing actor-network theory in a graphical format. To this end, a graphical syntax was designed based on a comprehensive conceptualisation of actor-network theory. METHOD. Design science research was used to produce an artefact (the graphical syntax) which is believed to be of practical use (relevant), innovative and based on a rigorous body of knowledge. ANALYSIS. The graphical syntax is illustrated in this paper only by means of a fictitious example in order to maintain focus on the syntax and the concepts depicted by the syntax. RESULTS. The strengths and weaknesses of the syntax are related to those of actor-network theory itself. The principal strength is the inclusion of heterogeneous actors in the analysis, and the main weakness relates to the vague boundaries of the theory. This weakness is addressed by the ability of the syntax to identify the primary research foci. CONCLUSIONS. It is proposed that actor-network theory can be successfully represented by a graphical syntax and that it can increase the utility of actor-network theory as a conceptual tool for information systems research.",

    "abstract": "Wie können bei der Bearbeitung von historischen Quellen entstandene Forschungsdaten langfristig und nachnutzbar (FAIR) online zur Verfügung gestellt werden? Dieser Frage wird in drei Schritten nachgegangen: Zuerst werden die Grundlagen des digitalen Datenaustauschs anhand der wichtigsten einschlägigen Standards bzw. Konzepte erarbeitet (Unicode, TEI, Linked Data und IIIF). In einem weiteren Schritt wird eine Auswahl von Editionssoftware bzw. -plattformen auf deren Tauglichkeit für kleine Editionsvorhaben geprüft. Die in den Vordergrund gestellten Projekte (FuD, Corpus Corporum, NIE-INE und Juxta Editions) verfolgen teilweise sehr unterschiedliche Ziele. Keines bietet eine ideale Lösung für ein kleines Editionsprojekt, alle haben jedoch gute Ansätze. Im letzten Teil geht es um die Frage, was eine ideale Editionsplattform für die Speicherung von Kleineditionen und bruchstückhaften Editionsergebnissen bieten würde. Während es viele mehr oder weniger dringende Eignungskriterien gibt, ist der Kern der Anforderung überschaubar: die Daten müssen FAIR aufbereitet werden, der einfache Zugang zur Editionsplattform muss in finanzieller und technischer Hinsicht gewährleistet sein und ein Minimum an gängigen einschlägigen Standards muss berücksichtigt werden. Aufgrund dieser minimalistischen Anforderungen ist zu hoffen, dass bald ein entsprechendes Produkt auf den Markt kommen wird.",

    "abstract": "The By the People (BTP) datasets comprise text of selected collections of the Library of Congress (LOC) created by volunteers in the By the People crowdsourced transcription program, which invites public transcription of historical documents. All transcriptions are created and reviewed by volunteers in a consensus-based model in which two or more volunteers must agree on a transcription for it to be considered complete. Resulting transcriptions are added to the digital collections alongside the images to enable search and accessibility of the collections. Additionally, completed transcription “campaigns” are published as freely downloadable datasets of .CSV files containing all campaign transcriptions, as well as minimal metadata. The datasets can support a multitude of purposes including computational research in fields such as history, linguistics, economics, and political science.",

    "abstract": "Digital research outputs in the form of websites, databases and interactive visualisation tools pose a challenge for long-term maintenance and reusability. A central problem for libraries and research institutions working in the digital humanities is that digital projects require constant maintenance: they are not static artefacts that can be preserved but living software environments that must be maintained. In this chapter, we argue in favour of creating semantically rich research data that can be separated from the software used to create and view it. We outline how we put this approach into practice, both within the scope of an individual research project and at scale, as libraries take on new responsibilities in managing digital research outputs. We hope to offer insights into the kind of artefacts that can be preserved in principle and the technical solutions with which reusability of research data can be achieved in order to make long-term preservation of digital research outputs feasible.",

    "abstract": "Digital archives of memory institutions are typically concerned with the cataloguing of artefacts of artistic, historical, and cultural value. Recently, new forms of citizen participation in cultural heritage have emerged, producing a wealth of material spanning from visitors’ experiential feedback on exhibitions and cultural artefacts to digitally mediated interactions like the ones happening on social media platforms. Citizen curation is proposed in the context of the European project SPICE (Social Participation, Cohesion, and Inclusion through Cultural Engagement) as a methodology for producing, collecting, interpreting, and archiving people’s responses to cultural objects, with the aim of favouring the emergence of multiple, sometimes conflicting, viewpoints and motivating users and memory institutions to reflect upon them. We argue that citizen curation urges to rethink the nature of computational infrastructures supporting data management of memory institutions, bringing novel challenges that include issues of distribution, authoritativeness, interdependence, privacy, and rights management. To approach these issues, we survey relevant literature toward a distributed, Linked Data infrastructure, with a focus on identifying the roles and requirements involved in such an infrastructure. We show how existing research can contribute significantly in facing the challenges raised by citizen curation and discuss challenges and opportunities from the socio-technical standpoint.",

    "abstract": "Interoperability is a qualitative property of computing infrastructures that denotes the ability of sending and receiving systems to exchange and properly interpret information objects across system boundaries. Since this property is not given by default, the interoperability problem and the representation of semantics have been an active research topic for approximately four decades. Early database models such as the Relational Model used schemas to express semantics and implicitly aimed at achieving interoperability by providing programming independence of data storage and access. Thereafter the Entity Relationship Model was introduced providing the basic building blocks of modeling real-world semantics. With the advent of distributed and object-oriented databases, interoperability became an obvious need and an explicit research topic. After a number of intermediate steps such as hypertext and (multimedia) document models, the notions of semantics and interoperability became what they have been over the last ten years in the context of the World Wide Web. With this article we contribute a retrospective on semantics and interoperability research as applied in major areas of computer science. It gives domain experts and newcomers an overview of existing interoperability techniques and points out future research directions.",

    "abstract": "Patients’ embodied experiences do not always correspond to the biomedical concepts of particular diseases. Drawing from year-long fieldwork in the Philippines that involved semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and digital diaries, we examine how individuals “do” hypertension through their embodied experiences and the knowledge and practice that emerge from them. Drawing inspiration from Annemarie Mol’s work on the notion of “multiplicity” of disease, our analysis was informed by a commitment to privileging patients’ embodied experiences and the multiple ontologies of hypertension. We find that for patients diagnosed with hypertension in the Philippines, symptoms enact illness; patients rely on their own embodied knowledge to define their illness’ nature (e.g., diagnosis), experience (e.g., frequency of symptoms and non-chronicity) and praxis (e.g., self-care practices). We show how this knowledge gained from having embodied experiences of living with the disease interacts in various ways with biomedical knowledge, other diagnostic labels and clinical practices, to shape how hypertension manifests and is managed by patients. Beyond interrogating the relationship between what counts as a “disease” and what is considered a “symptom”, our findings underscore the need to pay attention instead to the mutually co-constitutive processes of embodied experiences and disease categories in co-producing patient knowledge.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the spatial characteristics of science and technology. Originally seen as universal, and therefore outside space and place, studies in science, technology, and society (STS) located it first in specific locations—laboratories—and then in narrow networks linking laboratories. This double location implied that science is caught up in and enacts two topological forms— region and network—since objects in networks hold their shape by freezing relations rather than fixing Euclidean coordinates. More recent STS work suggests that science and technology also exist in and help to enact additional spatial forms. Thus some technoscience objects are fluid, holding their form by shifting their relations. And yet others achieve constancy by enacting simultaneous absence and presence, a topological possibility which we call here fire. The paper concludes by arguing that the “global” includes and is enacted in all four of these topological systems.",

    "abstract": "We all know that we have and are our bodies. But might it be possible to leave this common place? In the present article we try to do this by attending to the way we do our bodies. The site where we look for such action is that of handling the hypoglycaemias that sometimes happen to people with diabetes. In this site it appears that the body, active in measuring, feeling and countering hypoglycaemias is not a bounded whole: its boundaries leak. Bits and pieces of the outside get incorporated within the active body; while the centre of some bodily activities is beyond the skin. The body thus enacted is not self-evidently coherent either. There are tensions between the body?s organs; between the control under which we put our bodies and the erratic character of their behaviour; and between the various needs and desires single bodies somehow try to combine. Thus to say that a body is a whole, or so we conclude, skips over a lot of work. One does not hang together as a matter of course: keeping oneself together is something the embodied person needs to do. The person who fails to do so dies.",

    "abstract": "As Moore’s Law and associated technical advances continue to bulldoze their way through society, both exciting possibilities and severe challenges emerge. The upside is the explosive growth of data and compute resources that promise revolutionary modes of discovery and innovation not only within traditional knowledge disciplines, but especially between them. The challenge, however, is to build the large-scale, widely accessible, persistent and automated infrastructures that will be necessary for navigating and managing the unprecedented complexity of exponentially increasing quantities of distributed and heterogenous data. This will require innovations in both the technical and social domains. Inspired by the successful development of the Internet and leveraging the Digital Object Framework and FAIR Principles (for making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable by machines) the GO FAIR initiative works with voluntary stakeholders to accelerate convergence on minimal standards and working implementations leading to an Internet of FAIR Data and Services (IFDS). In close collaboration with GO FAIR and DONA, the RDA GEDE and C2CAMP initiatives will continue its FAIR DO implementation efforts..",

    "abstract": "The present volume “Digital Scholarly Editions as Interfaces” is the follow-up publication of the same-titled symposium that was held in 2016 at the University of Graz and the twelfth volume of the publication series of the Institute for Documentology and Scholarly Editing (IDE). It is the result of a successful collaboration between members of the Centre for Information Modelling at the University of Graz, the Digital Scholarly Editions Initial Training Network DiXiT, a EC Marie Skłodowska-Curie Action, and the IDE. All articles have undergone a peer reviewing process and are published in Open Access. They document the current state of research on design, application and implications of both user and machine interfaces in the context of digital scholarly editions. The editors of the volume are grateful to the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions for enabling not only the symposium in 2016 but also the publication of the present volume with their financial support. Special thanks are also due to the staff of the Centre for Information Modelling, above all Georg Vogeler, who contributed to the successful organisation and completion of the symposium and this volume with their ideas and continuous support. Furthermore we want to thank all authors as well as all peer reviewers for the professional cooperation during the publication process. Last but not least we want to thank the many people involved in creating the present volume: Barbara Bollig (Trier) for language corrections and formal suggestions, Bernhard Assmann and Patrick Sahle (Cologne) for support and advises during the typese ing process, Selina Galka (Graz) for verifying and archiving (archive.org) all referenced URLs in January 2018, Julia Sorouri (Cologne) for the design of the cover as well as the artist Franz Konrad (Graz), who provided his painting “Desktop” (www.franzkonrad.com/gallery/desktop-2008-2010/) as cover image. We hope you enjoy reading and get as much intrigued by the topic “Digital Scholarly Editions as Interfaces” as we did.",

This paper focuses on the knowledge representation and data modelling initiative that has characterised the first year of the EPNet project in the context of the historical research. The so-called EPNet CRM and Ontology are introduced here, and put in connection with existing modelling standards. The formal specification of the domain expert knowledge is the preliminary step toward the design of an innovative “Virtual Research Environment” for scholars of the Roman Empire. Potential and actual benefits coming from the knowledge representation initiative are also discussed, with the main aim of encouraging experts in the humanities in embracing an innovative paradigm whose proved efficacy can positively affect their current research practices.",

    "abstract": "Building models for integrating the diverse data generated in Cultural Heritage disciplines is a long-term challenge both for securing presently generated knowledge and for making it progressively more widely accessible and interoperable into the future. This chapter reviews the multiple approaches undertaken to address this problem, finally proposing CIDOC CRM as the most robust solution for information integration in CH. The chapter begins by outlining the data challenge specific to the field and the main approaches that can be taken in facing it. Within this frame, it distinguishes knowledge engineering and formal ontology from other information modelling techniques as the necessary approach for tackling the broader data integration problem. It then outlines the basic principles of CIDOC CRM, the ISO standard formal ontology for CH. From there, an overview is given of some of the work that has been done both theoretically and in practice over the past five years in developing and implementing CRM as a practical data integration strategy in CH, particularly looking at model extensions to handle knowledge provenance across various disciplines and typical documentation and reasoning activities, as well as at successful implementation projects. Lastly, it summarizes the present potentials and challenges for using CIDOC CRM for solving the CH data management and integration puzzle. The intended audience of this chapter are specialists from all backgrounds within the broader domain of CH with an interest in data integration and CIDOC CRM.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we review recent work aimed at the application of declarative logic programming to knowledge representation in artificial intelligence. We consider extensions of the language of definite logic programs by classical (strong) negation, disjunction, and some modal operators and show how each of the added features extends the representational power of the language. We also discuss extensions of logic programming allowing abductive reasoning, meta-reasoning and reasoning in open domains. We investigate the methodology of using these languages for representing various forms of nonmonotonic reasoning and for describing knowledge in specific domains. We also address recent work on properties of programs needed for successful applications of this methodology such as consistency, categoricity and complexity.",

    "abstract": "The conventional approaches to knowledge representation, e.g., semantic networks, frames, predicate calculus and Prolog, are based on bivalent logic. A serious shortcoming of such approaches is their inability to come to grips with the issue of uncertainty and imprecision. As a consequence, the conventional approaches do not provide an adequate model for modes of reasoning which are approximate rather than exact. Most modes of human reasoning and all of commonsense reasoning fall into this category.",

    "abstract": "This chapter describes the two broad categories in which one’s knowledge of the world can be divided: declarative knowledge, or knowledge of facts, and procedural knowledge, or knowledge of skills. Declarative knowledge is communicable; it can be acquired quickly and is flexible. Declarative knowledge representations can be further divided into analogical representations and symbolic representations. Analogical representations preserve information intrinsically, are tied to a particular sensory modality, and play a crucial role in many tasks but especially those whose solution requires the reenactment of previous experiences. Symbolic representations preserve information extrinsically, are abstract and amodal, and form the principal basis of logical inference. In contrast to declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge is difficult or impossible to communicate; it tends to be learned gradually and requires extensive practice. It is used in narrow, well-defined situations. The procedural knowledge employed in cognitive skills can be represented formally as productions. These condition–action rules involve the connection between thought and action.",

    "abstract": "Dans le cadre du développement de la bibliothèque numérique Fonte Gaia Bib, un projet franco-italien international à vocation participatif, cette thèse s’intéresse à l’un des problèmes les plus épineux des humanités numériques : l’identification de leur(s) public(s) et de leurs besoins. Dans la plupart des cas, en effet, les services entourant les bibliothèques numériques sont construits à partir des exigences de leurs créateurs, et en fonction des besoins présumés des utilisateurs ; lesquels utilisateurs ne sont rien d’autre que la projection des besoins et des caractéristiques des créateurs eux-mêmes. Cette stratégie a montré ses limites et une approche basée sur les besoins des utilisateurs finaux est encore marginale.La question des utilisateurs se pose d’autant plus dans le cadre du développement de services participatifs, qui reprennent les codes du Web Social et font passer les utilisateurs de consommateurs à acteurs. Dans le domaine des bibliothèques numériques patrimoniales et scientifiques, l’étude des services participatifs du point de vue de l’utilisateur est encore rare et peu spécifique, alors même que ce type de services soulève la question de la place des utilisateurs dans ce type de ressources numériques, et semble remettre en question le métier et les missions des bibliothécaires.Dans ce contexte, cette thèse définit une méthode de conception centrée utilisateur appliquée au cas d’une bibliothèque numérique participative et scientifique. Nous mettons plus particulièrement l’accent sur l’étape de modélisation et de maquettage des services, en tant que processus heuristiques qui visent à donner corps à un modèle théorique et qui ont une fonction centrale dans le cycle de vie d’un projet et dans son workflow. À travers cette méthode et le cas de Fonte Gaia, nous proposons une étude des services participatifs d’une bibliothèque numérique basée sur le public engagement, un modèle participatif encore peu présent dans le monde du patrimoine et des humanités numériques, mais qui permettrait de définir des services en accord avec les besoins des utilisateurs et les missions des bibliothécaires. Cette étude des services sous l’angle du public engagement nous a permis de démontrer le bien-fondé d’une distinction stricte entre services coopératifs et services collaboratifs, qui n’impliquent pas les mêmes publics et qui ne sont pas représentés de la même façon au sein d’une bibliothèque numérique.Cette thèse étudie ainsi à la fois une interaction, celle entre les services et leurs utilisateurs ; un modèle, celui du public engagement ; et une méthode, celle de la conception centrée utilisateur appliquée aux bibliothèques numériques patrimoniales. Ces différents aspects sont étroitement liés : le public engagement constitue un type d’interaction particulier entre un utilisateur et un service. Il nous permet de pousser l’engagement des utilisateurs avec le patrimoine écrit à son extrême et de définir différents degrés de participation. Cela est rendu possible par la modélisation d’une bibliothèque participative via la conception centrée utilisateur. Cette dernière est non seulement notre méthode d’étude des services et du public engagement, en ayant recours à des questionnaires, des entretiens, des ateliers de maquettage participatif et un hackathon ; mais également un objet de recherche en lui-même, en tant que méthode peu employée en bibliothèque numérique patrimoniale. Ces différents éléments de notre thèse nous permettent d’analyser une bibliothèque numérique sous un angle nouveau, en dépassant l’image d’une bibliothèque fournisseur de données pour celle d’une bibliothèque tournée vers ses utilisateurs et encourageant leur engagement avec le patrimoine écrit.",

    "abstract": "There is a certain “failure” in what we could call the modern development of the STS field over the past decade, i.e. a large number of studies—particularly empirical—that were deployed from the 1970s onwards. Indeed, one of their original and crucial objectives was to emphasize the local, situated, contingent character of the processes of production and negotiation of knowledge. However, these studies mostly concentrate on one part of the world, i.e. the most developed countries, precisely where modern science, commonly referred to as “Western Science,” developed. This limitation—surely intuitive or “natural”—has several consequences analyzed in this article. In summary, these limitations can be analyzed in terms of the objects of research (the various forms of knowledge) but also in terms of the theories and methods used to account for them. The aim is to discuss the construction of a double (or even triple) peripheral situation, which calls into question the old principles of symmetry and impartiality (Bloor 1976; Collins 1981): on the one hand, the peripheral character of the objects analyzed (i.e. science and scientific development outside Euro-America) and, in parallel, the peripheral situation of the communities of specialists who dedicate themselves to studying them. Connected to this, an additional question emerges: What are the theoretical frameworks and methodologies best suited to account for these objects in their respective contexts? Is it suitable to simply apply to these objects of study the same theoretical frameworks and methods commonly used to analyze hegemonic science? And last but not least, how to approach the (scientific, cultural, political) relationships between different contexts in a highly globalized world? This is the first of two parts: while in the first one I discuss the “failures” of the hegemonic paradigm in STS and its consequences in relation to non-hegemonic contexts. The second part—appearing in volume 8, issue 3—focuses on the consequences for the case of STS research in Latin America and the dynamics of its specific agendas. Those who seek to \"provincialize CTS\" (Law and Li, 2015), or those who sustain postcolonial perspectives (Anderson, 2012, Harding, 2008 and 2016, among others), promote a real and important advance, since they question the hegemonic model of STS and intend to broaden their agendas to account for and understand the dynamics of technosciences in the \"other contexts\". It is not a question of finding \"new localities\" in different \"provinces\", but rather that the processes of techno-scientific development -both in central and peripheral contexts- are crossed by the complex and heterogeneous societies, where we find, for example, perfectly internationalized scientific elites, generally trained in \"central\" laboratories, coexisting with a multiplicity of other actors, some of them seeking to reproduce the internationalized canons, others questioning them, while a last group is only oriented by local dimensions.",

Models provide access to hidden realities by bridging the gap between the tangible and the abstract; models also alter perceptions and can have deep and lasting effects on human knowing. The collection argues for the importance of attending to this double action of modelling, and explores important epistemological questions.",

    "abstract": "The steady growth of multimedia collections - both in terms of size and heterogeneity - necessitates systems that are able to conjointly deal with several types of media as well as large volumes of data. This is especially true when it comes to satisfying a particular information need, i.e., retrieving a particular object of interest from a large collection. Nevertheless, existing multimedia management and retrieval systems are mostly organized in silos and treat different media types separately. Hence, they are limited when it comes to crossing these silos for accessing objects. In this paper, we present vitrivr, a general-purpose content-based multimedia retrieval stack. In addition to the keyword search provided by most media management systems, vitrivr also exploits the object’s content in order to facilitate different types of similarity search. This can be done within and, most importantly, across different media types giving rise to new, interesting use cases. To the best of our knowledge, the full vitrivr stack is unique in that it seamlessly integrates support for four different types of media, namely images, audio, videos, and 3D models.",

    "abstract": "The amount of digital cultural heritage data produced by cultural heritage institutions is growing rapidly. Digital cultural heritage repositories have therefore become an efficient and effective way to disseminate and exploit digital cultural heritage data. However, many digital cultural heritage repositories worldwide share technical challenges such as data integration and interoperability among national and regional digital cultural heritage repositories. The result is dispersed and poorly-linked cultured heritage data, backed by non-standardized search interfaces, which thwart users’ attempts to contextualize information from distributed repositories. A recently introduced geospatial semantic web is being adopted by a great many new and existing digital cultural heritage repositories to overcome these challenges. However, no one has yet conducted a conceptual survey of the geospatial semantic web concepts for a cultural heritage audience. A conceptual survey of these concepts pertinent to the cultural heritage field is, therefore, needed. Such a survey equips cultural heritage professionals and practitioners with an overview of all the necessary tools, and free and open source semantic web and geospatial semantic web platforms that can be used to implement geospatial semantic web-based cultural heritage repositories. Hence, this article surveys the state-of-the-art geospatial semantic web concepts, which are pertinent to the cultural heritage field. It then proposes a framework to turn geospatial cultural heritage data into machine-readable and processable resource description framework (RDF) data to use in the geospatial semantic web, with a case study to demonstrate its applicability. Furthermore, it outlines key free and open source semantic web and geospatial semantic platforms for cultural heritage institutions. In addition, it examines leading cultural heritage projects employing the geospatial semantic web. Finally, the article discusses attributes of the geospatial semantic web that require more attention, that can result in generating new ideas and research questions for both the geospatial semantic web and cultural heritage fields.",

    "abstract": "An Application Programming Interface (API) provides a programmatic interface to a software component that is often offered publicly and may be used by programmers who are not the API’s original designers. APIs play a key role in software reuse. By reusing high quality components and services, developers can increase their productivity and avoid costly defects. The usability of an API is a qualitative characteristic that evaluates how easy it is to use an API. Recent years have seen a considerable increase in research efforts aiming at evaluating the usability of APIs. An API usability evaluation can identify problem areas and provide recommendations for improving the API. In this systematic mapping study, we focus on 47 primary studies to identify the aim and the method of the API usability studies. We investigate which API usability factors are evaluated, at which phases of API development is the usability of API evaluated and what are the current limitations and open issues in API usability evaluation. We believe that the results of this literature review would be useful for both researchers and industry practitioners interested in investigating the usability of API and new API usability evaluation methods.",

    "abstract": "The modern abundance and prominence of data has led to the development of “data science” asa new field of enquiry, along with a body of epistemological reflections upon its foundations,methods, and consequences. This article provides a systematic analysis and critical review ofsignificant open problems and debates in the epistemology of data science. We propose a partitionof the epistemology of data science into the following five domains: (i) the constitution of datascience; (ii) the kind of enquiry that it identifies; (iii) the kinds of knowledge that data sciencegenerates; (iv) the nature and epistemological significance of “black box” problems; and (v) therelationship between data science and the philosophy of science more generally.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In recent decades, problems related to the accessibility and sustainability of science have increased, both in terms of the acquisition and dissemination of knowledge and its generation. Policymakers, academics, and, increasingly, citizens themselves have developed various approaches to this issue. Among them, citizen science is distinguished by making possible the generation of scientific knowledge by anyone with an interest in doing so. However, participation alone does not guarantee knowledge generation, which represents an epistemological challenge for citizen science. Simultaneously, economic and socio-institutional difficulties in science governance and maintenance have grown. To solve those problems, several market elements have been introduced, a solution rejected by those who consider science as a public good that states must guarantee. Alternatively, research and work on the commons are growing worldwide, the concept being extended from natural resources to knowledge resources. In this chapter, we propose science as a commons, underlining the essential role of citizen science. Difficulties also apply to citizen science itself, but the increasing development of a multitude of projects based on cooperation favours the conditions required for its sustainability and quality. Our philosophical proposal is based on empirical knowledge about citizen science coupled with socio-economic concepts, according to a sociopolitical epistemology.",

    "abstract": "The motion of four different spinning tops was filmed with a high-speed video camera. Unlike pointed tops, tops with a rounded peg precess initially about a vertical axis that lies well outside the top, and then spiral inward until the precession axis passes through a point close to the center-of-mass. The center-of-mass of a top with a rounded peg can rise as a result of rolling rather than sliding friction, contrary to the explanation normally given for the rise of spinning tops. A tippe top was also filmed and was observed to jump vertically off a horizontal surface several times while the center-of-mass was rising, contrary to the usual assumption that the normal reaction force on a tippe top remains approximately equal to its weight. It was found that the center-of-mass of a tippe top rises as a result of rolling friction at low spin frequencies and as a result of sliding friction at high spin frequencies. It was also found that, at low spin frequencies, a tippe top can precess at two different frequencies simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "Le présent article est la synthèse d’un travail de bachelor rédigé en anglais. Il a pour but de présenter la communauté IIIF et le projet NIE-INE, les tests d’utilisabilité sur Universal Viewer et Mirador. Les résultats des tests ont été présentés lors de la conférence IIIF qui s’est déroulée au Vatican du 5 au 9 juin 2017. International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF), initiative née en 2011, désigne un ensemble d’interfaces de programmation applicative (API) dans le but de visualiser, zoomer, comparer, et de manipuler des images sur le Web de manière interopérable à travers différents entrepôts. La mise en œuvre de ces spécifications techniques offre autant de possibilités aux institutions les implémentant qu’aux utilisateurs finaux accédant au contenu. En Suisse, très peu d’institutions ont collaboré avec la communauté IIIF depuis sa création. L’exemple le plus abouti est e-codices, la bibliothèque numérique des manuscrits, qui est la seule institution suisse à avoir implémenté en décembre 2014 les deux API principales de IIIF (Image API et Presentation API). Si peu de bibliothèques ou d’institutions patrimoniales suisses ont connaissance de IIIF, le projet « Infrastructure nationale pour les éditions » (NIE-INE) qui a démarré en octobre 2016 pourrait bien faire évoluer les choses. NIE-INE est supervisé par le Forum für Edition und Erschliessung (FEE) de l’Université de Bâle et est financé par le fonds CUS-P2 de Swissuniversities. Il vise à construire une plateforme nationale rassemblant des éditions scientifiques, notamment en sciences humaines. Etant donné que NIE-INE partage de multiples intérêts communs avec IIIF, comme la préconisation d’une architecture technique flexible ou encore l’amélioration de l’expérience utilisateur (UX), des tests d’utilisabilité ont été effectués sur Mirador et Universal Viewer (UV), deux interfaces compatibles avec les API de IIIF. L’une de ces interfaces pourrait ainsi devenir une brique de leur pile technologique. Les tests d’utilisabilité à distance et en présentiel ont été effectués avec pour public cible les futurs utilisateurs de la plateforme de NIE-INE et les chercheurs travaillant dans les humanités numériques. Deux axes d’évaluation principaux ont été choisis (la satisfaction et l’efficience) afin de mesurer à quel point la communauté scientifique pouvait tirer profit des technologies compatibles aux standards de IIIF.",

    "abstract": "Scholars across the humanities, social sciences, and information sciences are grappling with how best to study virtual environments, use computational tools in their research, and engage audiences with their results. Classic work in science and technology studies (STS) has played a central role in how these fields analyze digital technologies, but many of its key examples do not speak to today’s computational realities. This groundbreaking collection brings together a world-class group of contributors to refresh the canon for contemporary digital scholarship. In twenty-five pioneering and incisive essays, this unique digital field guide offers innovative new approaches to digital scholarship, the design of digital tools and objects, and the deployment of critically grounded technologies for analysis and discovery. Contributors cover a broad range of topics, including software development, hackathons, digitized objects, diversity in the tech sector, and distributed scientific collaborations. They discuss methodological considerations of social networks and data analysis, design projects that can translate STS concepts into durable scientific work, and much more. Featuring a concise introduction by Janet Vertesi and David Ribes and accompanied by an interactive microsite, this book provides new perspectives on digital scholarship that will shape the agenda for tomorrow’s generation of STS researchers and practitioners.",

    "abstract": "The cartography of controversies is a set of techniques to explore and visualize issues. It was developed by Bruno Latour as a didactic version of Actor-Network Theory to train college students in the investigation of contemporary socio-technical debate. The scope and interest of such cartography, however, exceed its didactic origin. Adopted and developed in several universities in Europe and the US, the cartography of controversies is today a full research method, though, unfortunately, not a much documented one. To fill this lack of documentation, we draw on our experience as Latour’s teaching assistant, to introduce some of the main techniques of the social cartographer toolkit. In particular, in these pages we will focus on exploration, leaving the discussion of visualization tools to a further paper.",

    "abstract": "The crucial claim of social constructivism is that a sociological analysis of science and scientific knowledge is fruitful and reveals the social nature of science. The development of scientific knowledge is seen to be determined by social forces, essentially contingent and independent of rational methods, and analyzable in terms of causal processes of belief formation. There are three main social constructivist approaches. The Edinburgh school of the sociology of science maintains that it is not only the development but also the content of scientific theories that is determined by social factors. The leading idea of the actor-network theory is that scientific knowledge is an effect of established relations between objects, animals, and humans engaged in scientific practices. Social constructivism about the social is an intentionalist program of social ontology trying to clarify how social entities like social groups and institutions are constructed. The article discusses the historical background of social constructivism and the three approaches mentioned above in some detail.",

    "abstract": "Themed web archive collections exist to make sense of archived web pages (mementos). Some collections contain hundreds of thousands of mementos. There are many collections about the same topic. Few collections on platforms like Archive-It include standardized metadata. Reviewing the documents in a single collection thus becomes an expensive proposition. Search engines help find individual documents but do not provide an overall understanding of each collection as a whole. Visitors need to be able to understand what individual collections contain so they can make decisions about individual collections and compare them to each other. The Dark and Stormy Archives (DSA) Project applies social media storytelling to a subset of a collection to facilitate collection understanding at a glance. As part of this work, we developed the DSA Toolkit, which helps archivists and visitors leverage this capability. As part of our recent International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC) grant, Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and Old Dominion University (ODU) piloted the DSA toolkit with the National Library of Australia (NLA). Collectively we have made numerous improvements, from better handling of NLA mementos to native Linux installers to more approachable Web User Interfaces. Our goal is to make the DSA approachable for everyone so that end-users and archivists alike can apply social media storytelling to web archives.",

    "abstract": "It is often argued that ANT fails to offer a satisfactory theory of the actor which is allegedly endowed either with limitless power, or deprived of any room for manoeuvre at all. The aim of this paper is to show that the absence of a theory of the actor, when combined with the role attributed to non-humans in the description of action, is precisely one of the strengths of ANT that it is most important to preserve. This is because this combination makes it possible to explain the existence and the working of economic markets. Any particular market is the consequence of operations of disentanglement, framing, internalization and externalization. ANT makes it possible to explain these operations and the emergence of calculating agents. Homo economicus is neither a pure invention, nor an impoverished vision of a real person. It indeed exists, but is the consequence of a process in which economic science places an active role. The conclusion is that ANT has passed one of the most demanding tests: that of the market.",

    "abstract": "This article introduces a frame of reference for understanding the fundamental challenges that inform digital humanities as an interdisciplinary research area between arts, humanities, information, and computer science. Its conclusions are based upon the evidence base developed within an EU-funded collaboration known as Knowledge Complexity, or KPLEX for short (www.kplex-project.eu), in particular via the project’s thirty-eight linked interviews about big data research. When viewed from the perspective of the digital humanities, five distinct points of “aporia” with a significant impact on digital humanities (DH) appear in this corpus, places where the interviewees explicitly or tacitly expose gulfs between the epistemic cultures that contribute to DH and that create tensions between these disciplines, even as they seek to collaborate. This article will explore these areas of apparent irreconcilability, and conclude with a series of reflections on how digital humanities researchers might build upon their unique competency profile to negotiate within these critical conversations, in particular in the framework of the emerging subfield of critical digital humanities.",

    "abstract": "This paper outlines a new approach to the study of power, that of the sociology of translation. Starting from three principles, those of agnosticism (impartiality between actors engaged in controversy), generalised symmetry (the commitment to explain conflicting viewpoints in the same terms) and free association (the abandonment of all a priori distinctions between the natural and the social), the paper describes a scientific and economic controversy about the causes for the decline in the population of scallops in St. Brieuc Bay and the attempts by three marine biologists to develop a conservation strategy for that population. Four “moments” of translation are discerned in the attempts by these researchers to impose themselves and their definition of the situation on others: (a) problematisation: the researchers sought to become indispensable to other actors in the drama by denning the nature and the problems of the latter and then suggesting that these would be resolved if the actors negotiated the “obligatory passage point” of the researchers’ programme of investigation; (b) interessement: a series of processes by which the researchers sought to lock the other actors into the roles that had been proposed for them in that programme; (c) enrolment: a set of strategies in which the researchers sought to define and interrelate the various roles they had allocated to others; (d) mobilisation: a set of methods used by the researchers to ensure that supposed spokesmen for various relevant collectivities were properly able to represent those collectivities and not betrayed by the latter. In conclusion it is noted that translation is a process, never a completed accomplishment, and it may (as in the empirical case considered) fail.",

    "abstract": "At its inception innocent of philosophical or metaphysical designs, the Gaia hypothesis of James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis was soon liberated from the precincts of scientific cultivation to enter into cultural free association. Nonetheless, scientific and scholarly attention and debate have long precipitated a bona fide discourse of Gaia theory. Moreover, intellectually serious extra-scientific figures of Gaia have also been on the rise in the last decade. This essay treats a selection of these newer Gaian figures, specifically, Isabelle Stengers’s Gaia the Intruder and Bruno Latour’s secular Gaia, in relation to Lovelock’s Gaia and Lynn Margulis’s evocations of autopoietic Gaia. When nuanced through second-order systems theory, the discourse of autopoietic Gaia satisfies Stengers’s and Latour’s demands for a non-holistic, heterogeneous yet coherent Gaia concept fit for communicative efficacy in the so-called Anthropocene epoch.",

    "abstract": "Désormais considérés comme gisement de valeur ajoutée, les patrimoines culturels font l’objet de nombreux projets de numérisation, à l’initiative d’établissements publics de recherche comme de compagnies privées, visant explicitement le développement de produits de connaissance à destination des marchés. Pour autant, au-delà des mots d’ordre distillés ici et là, on ne sait encore presque rien des modalités concrètes du déploiement de ce qui se présente comme un nouveau paradigme. La mise en œuvre de la valorisation techno-patrimoniale génère-t-elle des transformations dans la définition de ce qui compte comme patrimoine ? S’inscrivant dans le domaine des Science and Technologie Studies, l’analyse repose sur une ethnographie menée au sein du Montreux Jazz Digital Project porté par l’École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne. Véritable laboratoire de la mise en œuvre du paradigme de la valorisation techno-patrimoniale, l’objectif premier de ce projet est d’impulser le développement de produits de connaissance en reformulant la collection d’enregistrements audiovisuels produite au Montreux Jazz Festival en une collection de 46 000 pièces musicales, désormais déployées sur des écrans depuis lesquels leur destin est orienté. L’analyse permet de constater que la numérisation prolonge l’histoire longue des technologies d’écriture et d’accumulation, et renouvelle (plus qu’inaugure) les rapports entre technologies et patrimoine. La visibilité portée par les patrimoines et son potentiel transfert aux réalisations technologiques sont constituées en en horizon de l’action collective. Ainsi, les modalités du transfert de visibilité, dont la démo est l’opérateur privilégié, agissent sur toutes les étapes du processus de numérisation, avant même que les opérations de conservation numérique ne soient mises en œuvre. Finalement, cette étude montre que la valeur patrimoniale pourrait se retrouver toute entière indexée sur son potentiel d’innovation et de transfert de visibilité. Ce basculement entraîne des modifications du rapport au passé, réinterprété par le prisme d’un présent technologique continu dans lequel les notions de conservation, de transmission et de mémoire ne trouvent que difficilement leur place.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In 1923, Walter Benjamin published translations of Baudelaire’s poetry with a prefatory essay the idea that translation is therefore not only the practice of addressing foreign readerships, but rather a process of authorship in which the original text is amplified with further significance. The authors use the term translation with a meaning that is not only linguistic but also visual. They analyze the coronavirus pandemic by translating scientific literacy through the techniques of natural language processing and data visualization. The Cartography of COVID-19 results from a visual translation that invites readers to explore the current pandemic from a different point of view that extends their perception.",

    "abstract": "Cultural heritage institutions have a great deal to gain from deeply engaging in the networked environment. They have poured many resources in the digitization of their collections for the benefit of their audiences, from students to experts, who want to have access to more online material of a higher quality. The current landscape of cultural heritage knowledge on the Web, however, is very much siloed, which both harms the relevance of individual institutions as well as the overall state of scholarship which might use that knowledge. This talk will give an overview of previous initiatives and technologies intended to open up access to cultural heritage institutions, particularly art museums, including the International Council of Museums Committee for Documentation Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC CRM, also an ISO standard); The American Art Collaborative (AAC); PHAROS, the International Consortium of Photo Archives; the Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT); the Union List of Artist Names (ULAN); and the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF). In the context of the successes and limitations of these efforts, this paper will outline the strategy taken by Linked Art. This presentation will challenge the traditional paradigm which has large and wealthy institutions succeed in the face of structural challenges. In this era of hyper connectedness, the solution to museums’ relevance in the Web cannot be developed by a lone institution, and indeed the model that Linked Art promotes is instead based on inclusion with the goal to create institutional and individual partnerships. The other precept that the Linked Art data model advocates for is usability over absolute data completeness, and this talk will go over some specific data modeling principles that allow balance between the requirements of the institution, domain knowledge experts, technologists who will implement the standard, and scholars and other users of Linked Art.",

    "abstract": "Wikidata is evolving as the hub of Linked Open Data (LOD), with its language-neutral URIs and close adherence to Wikipedia. Well defined URIs help the data to be interoperable and linkable. This paper examines the possibilities of utilizing Wikidata as the means of a vocabulary resource for promoting the use of linkable concepts. Digital curation projects are vibrant with varying demands and purposes, which makes them less suitable for adopting any common vocabularies or ontologies. Also, developing and maintaining custom vocabularies are expensive processes for smaller projects in terms of resources and skill requirements. In general, Wikidata entities are well documented with Wikipedia entries, and Wikipedia entries express the conceptual and hierarchical relations in detail with provisions to modify or create. The authors explain the concept of using Wikidata as a vocabulary source with a proof of concept module implementation for Omeka-S, a widely adapted open source digital curation platform. This paper is expected to show some practical insights on reliable an reasonable vocabulary development for social informatics as well as cultural heritage projects, with a notion to improve the quality and quantity of linkable data from digital curation projects.",

    "abstract": "The Open Annotation Core Data Model specifies an interoperable framework for creating associations between related resources, called annotations, using a methodology that conforms to the Architecture of the World Wide Web. Open Annotations can easily be shared between platforms, with sufficient richness of expression to satisfy complex requirements while remaining simple enough to also allow for the most common use cases, such as attaching a piece of text to a single web resource. This paper presents the W3C Open Annotation Community Group specification and the rationale behind the scoping and technical decisions that were made. It also motivates interoperable Annotations via use cases, and provides a brief analysis of the advantages over previous specifications.",

We (Europeana and data providers) report on case studies that tested the application of some of the most promising Web technologies, exploring several solutions based on the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) and Sitemaps. We also describe an analysis of the Schema.org vocabulary for application in the context of cultural heritage and metadata aggregation. The solutions were tested successfully and leveraged on existing technology and knowledge in cultural heritage, with low implementation barriers. The future challenges lie in choosing among the several possibilities and standardizing solution(s). Europeana will proceed with recommendations for its network and is actively working within the IIIF community to achieve this goal.",

    "abstract": "Digital cultural heritage resources are widely available on the web through the digital libraries of heritage institutions. To address the difficulties of discoverability in cultural heritage, the common practice is metadata aggregation, where centralized efforts like Europeana facilitate discoverability by collecting the resources’ metadata. We present the results of the linked data aggregation task conducted within the Europeana Common Culture project, which attempted an innovative approach to aggregation based on linked data made available by cultural heritage institutions. This task ran for one year with participation of twelve organizations, involving the three member roles of the Europeana network: data providers, intermediary aggregators, and the central aggregation hub, Europeana. We report on the challenges that were faced by data providers, the standards and specifications applied, and the resulting aggregated metadata.",

    "abstract": "Dans un contexte archivistique en transition, marqué par l’évolution des normes internationales de description archivistique et le passage vers une logique de graphes d’entités, cette thèse se concentre plus spécifiquement sur la gestion des données d’autorité relatives à des personnes physiques. Elle vise à explorer comment le secteur des archives peut bénéficier du développement du Web de données pour favoriser une gestion soutenable de ses données d’autorité : de leur création à leur mise à disposition, en passant par leur maintenance et leur interconnexion avec d’autres ressources.La première partie de la thèse est dédiée à un état de l’art englobant tant les récentes évolutions des normes internationales de description archivistique que le développement de l’écosystème Wikibase. La seconde partie vise à analyser les possibilités et les limites d’une approche faisant appel au logiciel libre Wikibase. Cette seconde partie s’appuie sur une étude empirique menée dans le contexte du Centre d’Études et de Documentation Guerre et Sociétés Contemporaines (CegeSoma). Elle permet de tester les perspectives dont disposent des institutions possédant des ressources limitées et n’ayant pas encore adopté la logique du Web de données. Par le biais de jeux de données relatifs à des personnes liées à la Seconde Guerre mondiale, elle dissèque les différentes étapes conduisant à leur publication sous forme de données ouvertes et liées. L’expérience menée en seconde partie de thèse montre comment une base de connaissance mue par un logiciel tel que Wikibase rationalise la création de données d’autorité structurées multilingues. Des exemples illustrent la façon dont ces entités peuvent ensuite être réutilisées et enrichies à l’aide de données externes dans le cadre d’interfaces destinées au grand public. Tout en soulignant les limites propres à l’utilisation de Wikibase, cette thèse met en lumière ses possibilités, en particulier dans le cadre de la maintenance des données. Grâce à son caractère empirique et aux recommandations qu’elle formule, cette recherche contribue ainsi aux efforts et réflexions menés dans le cadre de la transition des métadonnées archivistiques.",

    "abstract": "Les projets en humanités numériques utilisent de plus en plus des méthodes de collaboration axées sur le public, telles que le crowdsourcing pour atteindre les objectifs de recherche, de conservation et d’édition scientifique en sciences humaines et sociales. Par exemple, le crowdsourcing représente une opportunité pour accélérer les projets de transcription pour des communautés de chercheurs qui travaillent traditionnellement dans des circuits-fermés. Certaines questions importantes soulevée par les chercheurs et les érudits concernent notamment l’intérêt de la méthode, et en particulier la qualité des résultats obtenus avec cette méthode. En outre, l’efficacité du crowdsourcing pour les humanités numériques n’est pas documenté dans la littérature. Se pose ainsi la question de savoir si le public peut produire du matériel pouvant être par la suite utilisé pour des éditions scientifiques, auxquels cas, pour quel type de projet et combien de post-traitement ou corrections seront nécessaires.Cette thèse de doctorat examinera le potentiel apport du crowdsourcing des transcriptions pour les projets d’édition scientifique en humanités numériques. Pour cela, nous allons premièrement explorer les technologies et les techniques disponibles pour produire les transcriptions sous format XML en ligne. Deuxièmement, ayant développé et testé une plateforme internet de transcription que nous présenterons, nous pourrons examiner les besoins des utilisateurs vis-à-vis des environnements de travail collaboratifs fondées sur les retours des utilisateurs et les environments de crowdsourcing industriels existants. Troisièmement, les données récoltées seront soumises à une analyse numérique qui permettra de comparer les productions des experts et celle des non-experts en s’appuyant sur les mesures de distances entre documents. Les résultats obtenus permettront de déterminer le potentiel apport du crowdsourcing pour les projets d’édition numérique scientifique. Enfin, le travail se terminera avec une discussion sur les implications des travaux actuels et présentera des opportunités pour des recherches futures sur le terrain.",

    "abstract": "In this study, two different usability-testing methods (Heuristic Evaluation and User Testing) were selected to test the usability of a pre-release version of software searching for Science, Mathematics and Engineering education materials. Our major goal is to compare Heuristic Evaluation and User Testing in terms of efficiency, effectiveness and cost/benefit analysis. We found that Heuristic Evaluation was more efficient than User Testing in finding usability problems (41 vs. 10), while User Testing was more effective than Heuristic Evaluation in finding major problems (70% vs.12%). in general, Heuristic Evaluation appears to be more economic in finding a wide range of usability problems by incurring a low cost in comparison to User Testing. However, User Testing can provide more insightful data from real users such as user’s performance and satisfaction.",

    "abstract": "A very large number of online cultural heritage (CH) resources is made available through numerous digital libraries. To address the difficulties of discoverability in CH, the common practice is metadata aggregation, where centralized efforts like Europeana facilitate discoverability by collecting the resources’ metadata. In the last years, the CH domain has invested in data models for Linked Data (LD) representation of CH metadata. LD, however, also has potential for innovating metadata aggregation. We present the results of a pilot case study within the Europeana Network. In this pilot, the National Library of The Netherlands plays the role of initial data provider, with the Dutch Digital Heritage Network the one of intermediary service providing datasets to Europeana. We analysed the requirements for an LD aggregation solution and defined a workflow that fulfils the same functional requirements as Europeana’s current solution. The workflow was put into practice within the pilot and led to the development of several software components for managing datasets, harvesting LD, data analysis and integration. Our analysis of the experience discusses the effort of adopting such an LD approach for data providers and aggregators, the expertise required by CH data analysts, and the supporting tools required for semantic data.",

    "abstract": "The Simple Image Presentation Interface (SIPI) is a multithreaded, high-performance, IIIF compatible media server developed by the Data and Service Center for the Humanities (DaSCH) at the University of Basel. It is designed to be used by archives, libraries, and other institutions that need to preserve high-quality images while making them available online. SIPI has implemented the IIIF Image API 3.0, and efficiently converts between image formats, preserving metadata contained in image files. In particular, if images are stored in JPEG 2000 format, SIPI can convert them on the fly to formats that are commonly used on the Internet. It offers a flexible framework for specifying authentication and authorisation logic in Lua scripts. In addition SIPI preserves most of the EXIF, IPTC and XMP metadata and can preserve or transform ICC colour profiles. SIPI is free software, released under the GNU Affero General Public License. It is written in C++ and runs on Linux and Mac OS. For the time being, the user has to provide a licensed source of the kakadu software to compile SIPI. This lightning talk given at the 2021 IIIF Annual Conference was an opportunity to present the main functionalities of SIPI and to give hints on future developments. <em>The recording of this presentation can be viewed on the following YouTube video (at 41:38): https://youtu.be/IOPZ5Gx-sH8?t=2498</em>",

    "abstract": "Die paradigmatische Institution des Speichergedächtnisses ist das Archiv, das gern als „Schatzkammer des Wissens“ oder „Gedächtnis der Gesellschaft“ angesprochen wird. Welche Aufgaben erfüllt es, wie hat es sich im Medienwandel verändert, mit welchen Problemen ist es konfrontiert? Diese Fragen führen mich im dritten und letzten Teil zu einer Gegenüberstellung von Archiv und Internet. Ich beginne mit einigen Bemerkungen zur Struktur und Organisation des Archivs. Das Archiv ist ein Ort der Ansammlung und nicht der Sammlung. Hier spielt der Zufall eine größere Rolle als die gezielte Steuerung, denn Archivgut fällt an und wird nicht eigens gesucht und in aller Regel nicht käuflich erworben. Mit den Tätigkeiten des Sicherns und Erhaltens ist es ganz auf eine Schutzfunktion zugeschnitten. Der gesellschaftliche Auftrag des Archivs liegt in der Konservierungs-, Ordnungs- und Erschließungsfunktion von Dokumenten. Archivare sind Dienstleister des Speichergedächtnisses in einer Zwischenstellung: sie halten Informationen vor, die später von anderen bewertet, aufbereitet und interpretiert werden. All das kann nicht die Aufgabe der Archivare sein, weshalb sie sich mit der Entscheidung der Auswahl zwischen dem, was relevant und was redundant ist, auch schwer tun und oft überfordert fühlen: „Was wertvoll oder Informationsmüll (wertlos) ist, ist in generellem Sinn theoretisch nicht begründbar.“",

    "abstract": "Abstract. Digital Cultural Heritage and Digital Humanities are, historically seen, in focus of different communities as well as approaching different research topics and - from an organizational point of view - departments. However, are they that different? The idea of this joint article involving digital humanists and heritage researchers is to examine communities, concepts and research applications as well as shared challenges. Beyond a collection of problem-centred essays this is intended to initiate a fruitful discussion about commonalities and differences between both scholarly fields as well as to assess to which extent they are two sides of the same medal.",

    "abstract": "Ce travail s’inscrit dans une réflexiongénéraleautour de la plateforme de valorisation du patrimoine genevois numérisé Mirabilia, et de sa dimension participative. L’objectif principal est de proposer une étudeconcernant la valorisation participative des documents manuscrits et des pistes de solutions visant àconstruire un projet allant dans ce sens, en prenant en compte les spécificités du contexte genevois, de ses institutions et de ses publics. Il s’agit d’une part de comprendre les besoins et attentes des tenants du projet et,d’autre part,d’aller à la rencontre d’usagers potentiels pour déterminer comment un tel projet peut les intéresser et leur être utile.La méthodologie utilisée s’inspire du Design Thinking et du User Experience. Elle se base sur des recherches personnelles (lectures, observations participantes et entretiens avec des experts), sur une analyse des tenants du projets (questionnaires), des publics (persona et questionnaires), et sur une intégration des usagers à la construction du projet (tri de cartes, prototypes et tests utilisateurs). Divers outils ont été réalisés au cours de ceprojet, telsun guide décisionnel pour lasélection de fonds, une cartographie des parties prenantes, des parcours utilisateurs, une maquette et une marche à suivre. Les circonstances n’ont pas permis la réalisation d’un prototype fonctionnel, mais il constituera une étape cruciale pourla suite du projet.Ces étapes ont permis de formuler des lignes directrices et des recommandations, et de relever l’importance de la prise en compte des usagers et de leurs opinions, qui ne coïncident pas toujours avec la vision des tenants du projet. Selon leurs profils, les usagers n’ont d’ailleurs pas les mêmes besoins et attentes.Les «amateurs», qui fréquenteraient la plateforme pour le loisir, rechercheraient une forme de communauté, une possibilité de se rencontrer en groupes d’intérêt et de collaborer à un projet degrande envergure. Ils peuvent s’intéresser à des thématiques très variées, proposées par les institutions, mais ils ont besoin de de se sentir légitimes dans leur participation et de voir que leurs contributions sont utiles. Dansles domaines de l’éducation et de la recherche, il est impératif d’aller chercher le dialogue avec les personnes concernéespour déterminer des thématiques et des fonds à valoriser.Leur intérêt pour la plateforme dépend deleurs sujets de recherche et d’enseignement, et s’ils nesont pas consultés, ils risquent de ne pas voir d’utilité immédiate à la plateforme.Il faut donc que les tenants du projet soient prêts à intégrer les usagers dans la construction de ce projet participatif,et à leur laisser de la place, sans pour autant craindre pour l’image de leur institution. Il faut pour cela prendre le temps de définir des objectifs précis pour éviter l’écueil d’un projet «prétexte», sans autre but que de suivre la tendance à la participation. Il faudra ensuite continuer le processus entamé en créant des prototypes d’outils et en les faisant tester à des usagers potentiels, afin de s’assurer qu’ils répondent à leurs besoins et attentes.

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on exploring the usage patterns and regularities of co‐employment of various popular tags and their relationships with the activeness of users and the interest level of resources in social tagging. A hypernetwork for social tagging is constructed in which a tagging action is expressed as a hyperedge and the user, resource, and tag are expressed as nodes. Quantitative measures for the constructed hypernetwork are defined, including the hyperdegree and its distribution, the excess average hyperdegree, and the hyperdegree conditional probability distribution. Using the data set from Delicious, an empirical study was conducted. The empirical results show that multiple individual tags and one or very few popular tags are generally employed together in one tagging action, and the usage patterns and regularities of tags with varying popularity are correlated to both user activity and resource interest. The empirical results are further discussed and explained from the perspectives of tag functions and motivations. Finally, suggestions regarding the usage of various popular tags for both tagging users and service providers of social tagging are given.",

La foule est très diversifiée sur ces plateformes et inclut des contributeurs malveillants attirés par la rémunération des tâches et ne les réali-sant pas consciencieusement. Il est essentiel d’identifier ces contributeurs afin de ne pas considérer leurs réponses. Tous les contributeurs n’ayant pas les mêmes aptitudes pour une tâche, il semble pertinent d’accorder un poids à leurs réponses en fonction de leurs qualifications.

However, little research has been devoted to exploring the impact of various factors such as the content of a resource or crowdsourcing interface design on user tagging behavior. Although images’ titles and descriptions are frequently available in image digital libraries, it is not clear whether they should be displayed to crowdworkers engaged in tagging. This paper focuses on offering insight to the curators of digital image libraries who face this dilemma by examining i how descriptions influence the user in his/her tagging behavior and ii how this relates to the a nature of the tags, b the emergent folksonomy, and c the findability of the images in the tagging system. We compared two different methods for collecting image tags from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk’s crowdworkers-with and without image descriptions. Several properties of generated tags were examined from different perspectives: diversity, specificity, reusability, quality, similarity, descriptiveness, and so on. In addition, the study was carried out to examine the impact of image description on supporting users’ information seeking with a tag cloud interface. The results showed that the properties of tags are affected by the crowdsourcing approach. Tags from the \"with description\" condition are more diverse and more specific than tags from the \"without description\" condition, while the latter has a higher tag reuse rate. A user study also revealed that different tag sets provided different support for search. Tags produced \"with description\" shortened the path to the target results, whereas tags produced without description increased user success in the search task.",

    "abstract": "Digital humanities (DH) has gained the dubious reputation of struggling to define itself. Articles trying to define DH have become something of a genre—however, more often than not the conclusions boil down to “DH is undefinable” or even “DH must not be defined.” A question that is rarely addressed, though, is *why* DH is supposedly undefinable. In this paper we argue that this is not because it would be, for example, particularly difficult to come up with a definition or because unlike most other fields, DH would not benefit from delimiting its domain, but rather because the majority of researchers that self-identify as “DH scholars” are actively opposing a definition. This is due to the fact that they understand DH as “contemporary humanities,” i.e., humanities using contemporary tools, not a new discipline. While legitimate, this view is irreconcilable with the understanding of DH as the development and application of a new—computational—methodology in the humanities. We therefore come to the conclusion that there is ultimately no way around clearly delimiting these two opposing views; we propose to use the term “computational humanities” to refer to the latter field, and we present a concise definition.",

    "abstract": "Designed as a seminar to discuss the opportunities and challenges associated with embedding Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) in IIIF resources, this seminar brought together experts in both fields to discuss the potentials for wider implementation of PIDs within the IIIF Framework. The emergence of the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) has presented researchers with an opportunity to annotate and cite digitised or digital resources. However, many of the creative and scholarly uses of IIIF are stymied by an inability to reliably and persistently link to objects or collections of objects. Persistent identifiers are long lasting, digital references to resources, whether physical or digital, including objects published in IIIF.  The second webinar hosted by the Practical Applications of IIIF Project, highlighted the need for the ability to be able to consistently identify objects or collections of objects in IIIF.  Both the Practical IIIF and Heritage PIDs projects are actively gathering use cases on this topic to understand community needs in this area. Some initial use cases and issues the projects identified include: The ability to assign a PID for collection level manifests to showcase and present areas of a collection The ability to identify IIIF manifests with a PID, both static and dynamic The ability to create PIDs for user generated manifests, collections and annotations The ability to update existing IIIF manifests with PIDs to reflect new imaging or updated metadata. This seminar provided an occasion for a panel of international experts to discuss the opportunities and challenges these use cases present and suggest a way forward for individual implementations and the framework as a whole.  Panellists : Ben and Sara Brumfield ( FromThePage), Andy Irving (Bodleian Libraries), Rachael Kotarski (British Library), Joseph Padfield (National Gallery) and Julien Raemy (University of Basel and DaSCH). Agenda Introduction to topic and panelists Description of use cases followed by comments from panelists Q&A and Discussion This seminar is co-organised by Practical Applications of IIIF and Persistent Identifiers as IRO infrastructure (Heritage PIDs) both foundation projects in the Towards a National Collection programme.",

    "abstract": "Europeana provides access to more than 54 million cultural heritage objects through its portal Europeana Collections. It is crucial for Europeana to be recognized by search engines as a trusted authoritative repository of cultural heritage objects. Indeed, even though its portal is the main entry point, most Europeana users come to it via search engines., Europeana Collections is fuelled by metadata describing cultural objects, represented in the Europeana Data Model (EDM). This paper presents the research and consequent recommendations for publishing Europeana metadata using the Schema.org vocabulary and best practices. Schema.org html embedded metadata to be consumed by search engines to power rich services (such as Google Knowledge Graph). Schema.org is an open and widely adopted initiative (used by over 12 million domains) backed by Google, Bing, Yahoo!, and Yandex, for sharing metadata across the web It underpins the emergence of new web techniques, such as so called Semantic SEO., Our research addressed the representation of the embedded metadata as part of the Europeana HTML pages and sitemaps so that the re-use of this data can be optimized. , The practical objective of our work is to produce a Schema.org representation of Europeana resources described in EDM, being the richest as possible and tailored to Europeana’s realities and user needs as well the search engines and their users.",

    "abstract": "The Lifelog Search Challenge (LSC) is an annual benchmarking competition for interactive multimedia retrieval systems, where participating systems compete in finding events based on textual descriptions containing hints about structured, semi-structured, and/or unstructured data. In this paper, we present the multimedia retrieval system vitrivr, a long-time participant to LSC, with a focus on new functionality. Specifically, we introduce the image stabilisation module which is added prior to the feature extraction to reduce the image degradation caused by lifelogger movements, and discuss how geodata is used during query formulation, query execution, and result presentation.",

    "abstract": "In this chapter, the relationship between digital humanities, information science and lexicography is analysed, exploring new possibilities and challenges and revisiting lexicographic theories and practices resulting from the need to digitise dictionaries. Methodology applied to Vocabulário Ortográfico da Língua Portuguesa (Orthographic Vocabulary of the Portuguese Language; VOLP-1940) is described, aiming at promoting accessibility to cultural heritage content while fostering reusability. VOLP-1940 is the first orthographic vocabulary published by the Academia das Ciências de Lisboa (ACL), in 1940. The goal is to analyse the vocabularies with computational methods to better assess the importance of this work for the evolution of science and mentalities in the 20th century and to contribute to the current movement of creating innovative, data-driven computational methods for text digitisation, encoding and analysis. VOLP-1940’s digitisation aims to create a lexicographical resource encoded in TEI (Text Encoding Initiative), with structured information in SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organisation System), to guarantee its future connection to other systems and resources. This trans-disciplinary approach combines theories and methods of linguistics, lexicography and information science, placing the TEI and SKOS standards at the core of this research. This research also aims to fill in a gap in Portuguese lexicography, given that legacy dictionaries are still rare online.",

The talk will be an opportunity to discuss IIIF and to focus on the following two key points: Firstly, I will introduce the overarching architecture conceived in relation to the IIIF APIs within the \"Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives\" (PIA) project. Secondly, I will discuss how the PIA data model will be impacted by the crowdsourcing and user-generated annotations that will be conducted on three photographic collections of the Swiss Society for Folklore Studies (SSFS/SGV).

    "abstract": "Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA) is an interdisciplinary project based on three photographic collections (Atlas of Swiss Folklore, Family Kreis, Ernst Brunner) of the Swiss Society Folklore Studies (SSFS) which aims to \"design a visual interface with machine learning-based tools to make it easy to annotate, contextualise, organise and link both images and their meta-information, to deliberately encourage the participatory use of archives\". The human dimension is at the heart of the PIA project, allowing not only the enrichment and correction of metadata through crowdsourcing, but also enabling end users to generate their own collections - or stories - with new associated metadata as well as being able to upload personal content (call for images). Thus, a new data model will need to particularly take into account the following elements: Management of existing (non-controlled) keywords and the forthcoming folksonomy; Metadata correction and enrichment through crowdsourcing; Validation of metadata created by Machine Learning methods (notably Object Detection and Visual Text Co-Embedding); Annotation and transcription of digital surrogates and born-digital content that are compatible with the W3C Web Annotation Data Model; Linked Data reconciliation of entities (agent, concept, place) on the basis of the existing data model and the user-generated metadata; Content upload that could, to some extent, be compatible with the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF). PIA is as much about traditional crowdsourcing as it is about creating a modern Citizen Science platform that enables new uses and helps to streamline the research process of scholars. For this purpose, a user interface and various application programming interfaces (APIs) will be deployed to accommodate various forms of re-use by third parties. The presentation will give the current state of the data model, the different knowledge representations and the ways forward.",

    "abstract": "Many libraries, museums and archives, the so-called memory institutions, have developed digital collections of cultural and historical resources as a primary service they provide online. In this chapter those digital collections are called digital archives. Digital archives have been growing not only in their volumes but also in a variety of cultural domains, e.g., intangible cultural heritage, video games, new media arts etc. While memory institutions have well-established metadata standards for their collections, those conventional standards may not fit well with digital archives oriented to the new domains. This chapter aims to present a set of generalised data models designed as a basis to define metadata schemes for digital archives of various cultural domains, including intangible cultural heritage and new media arts. It shows data models defined for the Media Arts Database (MADB) and Japan Digital Theatre Archives (JDTA) developed as a part of projects funded by the Agency for Cultural Affairs of the Japanese Government. MADB collects metadata of artworks of manga (Japanese comics), animations, video games and new media arts, while JDTA is a digital archive of performing arts of various genres in Japan. The chapter discusses the data models based on some lessons learned from MADB and JDTA.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to develop a measurement scale for the digital sustainability practices in the organization. Considering that digital sustainability practices vary across industries and context, this study develops a scale of digital sustainability metrics, which is based on a comprehensive literature review. The proposed model was then tested with partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Several phases of qualitative and quantitative investigations of employees were conducted to propose and validate the construct of digital sustainability. The scale development process consists of initial item generation, item refinement, validity assessment and model testing. Four dimensions, namely, content, technology, preservation and promotion, were identified. A 16-item scale was proposed and validated. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed. Practitioners should focus on investing behind organisational resources and technologies that enhance the operationalisation of digital sustainability rather than seeking to promote the understanding of the concept and importance of digital sustainability. This study addresses the research gap, combining a focus group interview and literature review, followed by conceptualization and validation of a measurement scale of digital sustainability. Digital sustainability was validated as a manifestation of the availability, preservation, promotion and technological aspect of digital content in corporations.",

    "abstract": "Archaeological studies are a trans-disciplinary endeavor, where a number of different scientists collaborate to get a reasonable account of material artefacts, through the various phases of recovery, analysis, and, recently, also exhibition. A large amount of digital data support the whole process, and there is a high value of keeping the coherence of the information and knowledge contributed by each discipline. The paper introduces a modular computational ontology, which is in use in a comprehensive archaeological project, Beyond Archaeology. The ontology provides the information structure to all the phases of the project, from the excavation phase, to the archaeometric analyses, up to the design and the implementation of the exhibition. The computational ontology is compliant with CIDOC-CRM reference model and introduces a number of novel properties and classes to link the description of the archaeological world with the forms traditionally used by the archaeologists to record the excavation and data about findings on the field and in the lab. The forms are implemented through a CMS structured site, for the creation of a data base, that is also filled with multimedia items that are to be employed in interpretation and exhibition, respectively.",

The Working Meeting was organized as a practitioner-focused strategic thinking opportunity intended to explore topics related to archival discovery and delivery. Archival discovery and delivery is the phrase used by the Lighting the Way project describing what people, processes, and systems do to support finding, accessing, and using material from archives and special collections. It is intended to underscore the complexity and interdependence of the work, and to take a more expansive view of this work than one focused solely on archival functions as currently understood or as technical development and implementation. Working Meeting participants met in several facilitated sessions using techniques from Liberating Structures, an inclusive facilitation methodology, and followed an intentional progression of steps to generate and structure their ideas. The Lighting the Way Handbook includes case studies work from specific institutions, chapters exploring the impact of standards and best practices on archival discovery and delivery, and descriptions of emergent opportunities that advocate for new programmatic work, as well as an introduction that synthesizes the chapters and provides concrete recommendations about how to advance work on archival discovery and delivery.This project was made possible in part by the Institute of Museum and Library Services, through grant LG-35-19-0012-19. The views, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in this publication do not necessarily represent those of the Institute of Museum and Library Services.",

    "abstract": "The World Wide Web of pages has revolutionized the way we publish, exchange, and collaborate with information. However, a vast network of content based on publishing pages creates problems for effective search, discovery, and reuse. The Linked Open Data movement seeks to remedy these limitations by supporting a new Web of Data. While the popularity and availability of Linked Open Data increase, it does not necessarily support understanding or provide the context and meaning to make it useful for humanist researchers. It also does not necessarily include the scientific requirements of transparency and reproducibility. The complex and heterogeneous nature of humanities datasets, together with the different contexts or perspectives that they contain, require the addition of meaning (semantics) to make them useful, yet the Semantic Web has become the poor relation in term of adoption, despite promising the elements to support high-quality digital humanities projects, and create a Web of data that better represents human knowledge.",

    "abstract": "This thesis investigates tow key questions: firstly, how do two broad groups - academic, family and local historians, and the public - evaluate, use, and contribute to digital history resources? And consequently, what impact have digital technologies had on public participation and scholarly practices in historical research?Analysing the impact of design on participant experiences and the reception of digital historiography by demonstrating the value of methods drawn from human-computer interaction, including heuristic evaluation, trace ethnography and semi-structured interviews. This thesis also investigates the relationship between heritage crowdsourcing projects (which ask the public to help with meaningful, inherently rewarding tasks that contribute to a shared, significant goal or research interest related to cultural heritage collections or knowledge) and the development of historical skills and interests. It situates crowdsourcing and citizen history within the broader field of participatory digital history and then focuses on the impact of digitality on the research practices of faculty and community historians.Chapter 1 provides an overview of over 400 digital history projects aimed at engaging the public or collecting, creating or enhancing records about historical materials for scholarly and general audiences. Chapter 2 discusses design factors that may influence the success of crowdsourcing projects. Following this, Chapter 3 explores the ways in which some crowdsourcing projects encourage deeper engagement with history or science, and the role of communities of practice in citizen history. Chapter 4 shifts our focus from public participation to scholarly practices in historical research, presenting the results of interviews conducted with 29 faculty and community historians. Finally, the Conclusion draws together the threads that link public participation and scholarly practices, teasing out the ways in which the practices of discovering, gathering, creating and sharing historical materials and knowledge have been affected by digital methods, tools and resources.",

    "abstract": "Metadata are fundamental for the indexing, browsing and retrieval of cultural heritage resources in repositories, digital libraries and catalogues. In order to be effectively exploited, metadata information has to meet some quality standards, typically defined in the collection usage guidelines. As manually checking the quality of metadata in a repository may not be affordable, especially in large collections, in this paper we specifically address the problem of automatically assessing the quality of metadata, focusing in particular on textual descriptions of cultural heritage items. We describe a novel approach based on machine learning that tackles this problem by framing it as a binary text classification task aimed at evaluating the accuracy of textual descriptions. We report our assessment of different classifiers using a new dataset that we developed, containing more than 100K descriptions. The dataset was extracted from different collections and domains from the Italian digital library “Cultura Italia” and was annotated with accuracy information in terms of compliance with the cataloguing guidelines. The results empirically confirm that our proposed approach can effectively support curators (F1 $$\\sim $$ 0.85) in assessing the quality of the textual descriptions of the records in their collections and provide some insights into how training data, specifically their size and domain, can affect classification performance.",

Il propose une analyse des différentes facettes qui constituent les « actes éditoriaux » des œuvres de Rousseau, dans une perspective diachronique. À travers quatre thèmes transversaux – l’établissement du texte, le marché du livre, les modes de lecture et le droit d’auteur – sont mis en parallèle les contextes éditoriaux du XVIIIe siècle et d’aujourd’hui. L’article interroge ainsi les transformations des pratiques éditoriales dans une perspective temporelle large, en se basant sur l’exemple des œuvres complètes de Jean-Jacques Rousseau.",

In der Welt des Spiels, in dem Spielende ihre eigene Insel gestalten können, ist es nun möglich, zur «Insel» der Fondation Beyeler zu reisen. Dort kann virtuell durch die Parkanlage geschlendert werden und in den Ausstellungsräumen gibt es Kunstwerke zu entdecken – etwa von Claude Monet oder Kasimir Malewitsch. Neben der Fondation Beyeler sind bereits andere Kunstmuseen mit Aktivitäten rund um ‹Animal Crossing› aufgefallen, wenn auch mit einer etwas anderen Ausrichtung.

    "abstract": "Nowadays stock photo agencies often have millions of images. Non-stop viewing of 20 million images at a speed of 10 images per second would take more than three weeks. This demonstrates the impossibility to inspect all images and the difficulty to get an overview of the entire collection. Although there has been a lot of effort to improve visual image search, there is little research and support for visual image exploration. Typically, users start \"exploring\" an image collection with a keyword search or an example image for a similarity search. Both searches lead to long unstructured lists of result images. In earlier publications, we introduced the idea of graph-based image navigation and proposed an efficient algorithm for building hierarchical image similarity graphs for dynamically changing image collections. In this demo we showcase real-time visual exploration of millions of images with a standard web browser. Subsets of images are successively retrieved from the graph and displayed as a visually sorted 2D image map, which can be zoomed and dragged to explore related concepts. Maintaining the positions of previously shown images creates the impression of an \"endless map\". This approach allows an easy visual image-based navigation, while preserving the complex image relationships of the graph.",

After a general analysis and a narrative theory review, the first topic addressed is the long-lasting problem of harmonizing freedom of narration (human creativity) and the constraints of scientific reliability: a debate which is at least 150 years old, but become particularly important in the digital era. Then, it will be set a classification of storytelling elements (arena, characters) inspired on similar ones shaped in the domain of semantics for literature, in order to create a working tool suitable for virtual museums and historical dissemination in a broad sense.",

Information generated in the past is sent into the future by the current preservation environment. The proof that the preservation environment preserves authenticity and integrity while performing the communication constitutes a theory of digital preservation. We examine the representation information that is needed about the preservation environment for a theory of digital preservation. The representation information includes descriptions of the preservation management policies, the preservation processes, and the state information that is needed to verify the correct working behavior of the system. We demonstrate rule-based data grids that can verify that prior policies correctly enforced preservation properties, while sending into the future descriptions of the current preservation management policies.",

    "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Seit den Anfängen der Digitalisierung von Kulturgütern in den späten 1990er Jahren wurden zahlreiche spartenspezifische, meist technisch spezielle Lösungen für die Internet-Präsentation von Digitalisaten aus Archiven, Bibliotheken und Museen entwickelt. Die meisten Viewer zur Internet-Präsentation sind auf die Anforderungen einer einzigen Einrichtung beschränkt und bieten meist nur Zugang (Access) auf eine begrenzte Anzahl von lokalen, meist untereinander inkompatiblen Applikationen. Der 2011 entwickelte IIIF-Standard ist dabei, die Situation grundlegend zu ändern. IIIF definiert eine Reihe von öffentlich zugänglichen Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), um die Strukturierung, den Austausch und die Visualisierung digitaler Objekte für alle Kulturinstitutionen zu erleichtern. Zusammen mit einem IIIF-kompatiblen Betrachter wie Mirador bietet IIIF einen bisher unerreichten Grad an Interoperabilität, der es Institutionen erlaubt, ihre digitalen Inhalte in einer noch nie da gewesenen Art und Weise für Forschung und Wissenschaft zugänglich zu machen (Data Sharing). Dieser Artikel beschreibt die Möglichkeiten und Chancen des IIIF-Standards und von Mirador, einem IIIF-Viewer und Forschungstool am Beispiel der Bayerischen Staatsbibliothek. Die Bayerische Staatsbibliothek wird sukzessive die Präsentation von 1,2 Millionen digitalisierten Werken auf den IIIF-Standard umstellen.",

    "abstract": "Fotografien sind weit mehr als nur Illustrationsmaterial für Textquellen. Sie gehören zu den wichtigsten Medien der zweiten Hälfte des 19. und des ganzen 20. Jahrhunderts. Dennoch blieb ihnen in der Geschichtswissenschaft und in den Archiven während langer Zeit der Status als Quellen verwehrt. Ein wesentlicher Grund dafür liegt in der Prädominanz schriftlicher (amtlicher) Dokumente, die lange Zeit als die eigentlichen Quellen angesehen wurden. Bilder dagegen galten gemeinhin als Metier der Kunstgeschichte. Dass sich die Geschichtswissenschaften und die Archive gegenüber den Bildquellen schliesslich öffneten, ist nicht zuletzt der vermehrten Interdisziplinarität im Bereich der Geisteswissenschaften sowie dem \"Methodenmix\", wie das u. a. Gerhard Paul und Karin Hartewig postulieren, zu verdanken. Mehr oder weniger nahe verwandte geisteswissenschaftliche Disziplinen befruchteten sich bei der Arbeit an Bildquellen gegenseitig ebenso sehr, wie die unterschiedlichen analytischen Ansätze das hermeneutische Feld öffneten. Die Wirkung geht aber nicht nur in eine Richtung. Durch eine sorgfältige und umfassende Erschliessung der Bildquellen dürfte ebenfalls das Forschungsinteresse an diesen befeuert werden. Damit dieser Weg heute gegangen werden kann, war zuvor auch in den Archiven ein Umdenken erforderlich. Das fing zwar damit an, dass man Fotografien überhaupt erst als historische Quellen anerkennt und behandelt, hört aber damit nicht auf. Denn Bildquellen stellen für die Archivarbeit eine besondere Herausforderung dar. Bei der archivischen Bearbeitung dieser Quellen ist stets zu bedenken, dass sich durch die Methodenvielfalt und die Interdisziplinarität bei der Arbeit an ihnen Fragestellungen und Sichtweisen ergeben können, die zum Zeitpunkt der Bewertung und Erschliessung noch gar nicht absehbar sind. Es ist somit unerlässlich, das Maximum an verfügbaren Kontextinformationen aufzuzeichnen und zeitgenössischen wie späteren Forschern zugänglich zu machen. So kommt der Archivarin und dem Archivar eine wichtige Bedeutung bei der Bewertung, Erschliessung und Vermittlung von Fotografien zu. Die Bewertung fängt bereits bei der Akquisition von Beständen an. Schon dort ist es wichtig, Fotografien nicht nur als Illustrationsmaterial zu sehen, damit wichtige Kontextinformationen festgehalten werden können. So ist auch bei Fotografien das Wissen um die Provenienz von grosser Wichtigkeit. Wer ist der Bestandesbildner? Ist der Bestandesbildner mit dem Fotografen, gleich ob Berufsfotograf oder Amateur, identisch? In welchem Zusammenhang sind die Fotografien entstanden? Wie wurden sie verwendet? Oder aber es muss deklariert werden, wenn man das nicht eruieren konnte. Die Bestandesinformationen müssen in den Archiven auch zugänglich gemacht werden, vereinheitlicht mit Standards und Normen wie SEPIADES, ISAD (G) und ISAAR (CPF). Damit wird auch ein Austausch von Daten mit anderen Institutionen und ein Aufbau von gemeinsamen Datenbanken ermöglicht. Damit Fotos im Archiv einen adäquaten Stellenwert bekommen, ist es wichtig, dass sich Archivarinnen und Archivare nicht nur mit technischen und konservatorischen Aspekten der Fotografie auseinandersetzen, sondern auch mit ihrer gesellschaftlichen Bedeutung, mit der sich auch die historische Bildforschung befasst. Dieses Wissen lässt sich schliesslich in der Bewertung, Erschliessung und Vermittlung im Archiv fruchtbar umsetzen. Inzwischen übernehmen vermehrt Institutionen, die sich nicht in erster Linie mit Bildern beschäftigt haben, grosse Bildbestände; so zum Beispiel das Staatsarchiv Aargau das Ringier Bildarchiv, das Staatsarchiv des Kantons Waadt das Archiv von Edipresse, das Staatsarchiv Bern das Bildarchiv der Berner Zeitung sowie das Stadtarchiv Bern das Bildarchiv der Zeitung Der Bund. Damit tragen sie der wachsenden Bedeutung audiovisueller Quellen als Kulturgut für die ABD-Institutionen Rechnung. Damit erlangen Fotografien die Bedeutung, die ihnen in einem Archiv gebührt, und so lassen sie sich dann von der Forschung und von einer breiten Öffentlichkeit adäquat als historische Quellen und nicht nur als Illustrationsmaterial nutzen.",

    "abstract": "This paper is a preliminary examination of one of the ways in which anthropologists attempted to apply photography systematically within the growing body of anthropological method during the 1860s and early 1870s. It concentrates on the “type” photograph, the main purpose of which was to illustrate the characteristics of a racial group. However, a wide variety of material was categorized as “types” of anthropological interest, for the term was more widely used than in a strictly biological context. Anthropologists were nonetheless anxious to improve the quality of their scientific data. The paper examines the role of photography in this context, looking first at the broader framework and then more specifically at two nineteenth century projects, one from England, the other from Germany, which might be described as the “incunabula of visual anthropology”.",

    "abstract": "Whereas previous Sidney Mintz lectures have celebrated Mintzs work on inequality, racism, and ethnicity, I have chosen to speak to the broadest scope of his research and teaching in anthropology. A comparative perspective on human knowledge allows us to unravel a number of aspects of the cultural worlds which people construct. I argue that knowledge always has three faces: a substantive corpus of assertions, a range of media of representation, and a social organization. Using ethnographic materials from New Guinea and Bali and also from our own universities, I try to show how in different traditions of knowledge these faces will interrelate in particular ways and generate traditionspecific criteria of validity for knowledge about the world. Thus the trajectory of a tradition of knowledge will be to a large extent endogenously determined. This implies not a diffuse relativism of anything goes but a relativism in which we can demonstrate how already established thoughts, representations, and social relations to a considerable extent configure and filter our individual human experience of the world around us and thereby generate culturally diverse worldviews.",

    "abstract": "As information visualization is increasingly used to raise awareness about social issues, difficult questions arise about the power of visualization. So far the research community has not given sufficient thought to how values and assumptions pervade information visualization. Taking engaging visualizations as a starting point, we outline a critical approach that promotes disclosure, plurality, contingency, and empowerment. Based on this approach, we pose some challenges and opportunities for visualization researchers and practitioners.",

    "abstract": "The graphic portrayal of quantitative information has deep roots. These roots reach into histories of thematic cartography, statistical graphics, and data visualization, which are intertwined with each other. They also connect with the rise of statistical thinking up through the 19th century, and developments in technology into the 20th century. From above ground, we can see the current fruit; we must look below to see its pedigree and germination. There certainly have been many new things in the world of visualization; but unless you know its history, everything might seem novel.",

    "abstract": "Online-Diskussionen sind komplex. So kann sich etwa eine nahezu unbegrenzte Anzahl von Akteuren unterschiedlich häufig an einer Diskussion beteiligen, in verschiedensten medialen Formen ausdrücken und aufeinander oder auf andere Quellen beziehen, so dass kommunikative Netzwerke entstehen, die sich über die Zeit dynamisch verändern. Die Komplexität von Online-Diskussionen besteht schon auf der Mikro-Ebene des individuellen Medienhandelns und mehr noch auf der Meso-Ebene der dabei entstehenden kommunikativen Netzwerke. Um diese Komplexität empirisch greifbar zu machen, eignet sich das Konzept der Interaktivität. In bisherigen Studien über User-Kommentare wird Interaktivität meist lediglich über die Anzahl der Kommentare oder die Häufigkeit der gegenseitigen Bezugnahme untersucht. In dieser Studie entwickeln wir ein Konzept von Interaktivität auf der Basis der Vielfalt an Interaktivitätsdimensionen und in Weiterführung des Interaktivitäts-Analyseschemas von Van Dijk und de Vos (2001). Wir überprüfen dieses Konzept empirisch am Beispiel der Online-Diskussionen zum Klimawandel in den User-Kommentaren in Online-Nachrichtenmedien und wissenschaftlichen Expertenblogs. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass sich je nach Online-Öffentlichkeit unterschiedliche Formen von Interaktivität herausbilden und nicht generell von ’mehr’ oder ’weniger’ Interaktivität gesprochen werden kann.",

It highlights some of the strengths of dynamic maps and shows their value to humanities computing projects. However, there are also a number of weaknesses with existing technology and techniques. These are discussed and possible ways forward are suggested. It illustrates some of the issues by reference to the experiences of two case study projects that have been conducted at the Centre for Computing in the Humanities at King’s College London.",

    "abstract": "The visualization and analysis of spatial data can shed new light on the nature and meaning of data throughout the Humanities. However such work is often avoided because it is seen as requiring expensive new hardware and software resources or involving a substantial expenditure of time and effort overcoming a steep learning curve before worthwhile results can be obtained. The Centre for Computing in the Humanities at King’s College London collaborates with researchers in a variety of humanities disciplines on a range of projects that often involve a component of spatial data. This has given the Centre an opportunity to explore methods of visualizing, analysing and displaying spatial data in a range of humanities disciplines. This paper discusses some of the intellectual, research and practical issues affecting the use of spatial data in Humanities Computing projects. It is illustrated by examples from a number of projects at King’s College. Although it is grounded on specific examples to support the points being made the main aim is to draw out a series of general themes which affect the use of spatial data by researchers throughout the Humanities and increase awareness of what can be achieved with minimal resources and a little creative thought.",

    "abstract": "Am 10 Februar 2004 innerhalb der Reihe \"GrenzBereiche des Lesens\" gehaltener Vortrag. \"GrenzBereiche des Lesens\" ist eine kulturwissenschaftliche Vortragsreihe, die 2003 und 2004 an der Universität Frankfurt stattfand. Claus Zittel diskutiert in seinem Beitrag die Frage der Lesbarkeit von Bildern. Er analysiert die vielfältigen Bedeutungen, Darstellungsfunktionen und den argumentativen Stellenwert von Abbildungen in wissenschaftlichen Abhandlungen der Frühen Neuzeit. Anhand einer Fülle von Beispielen zeigt er, wie undifferenziert und trügerisch die verbreitete Vorstellung von der Evidenz wissenschaftlicher Bilder ist: Abbildungen sind weder eindeutig durch den illustrativen Zweck noch durch eine gegebene Evidenz bestimmt. Die Decodierbarkeit und Überzeugungskraft der Bilder hängt vielmehr von kulturell codierten und etablierten Sicht- und Denkweisen ab, die die Bilder selbst in produktiver Weise mit prägen. Status, Funktionen und Bedeutungen von Abbildungen differieren, und sie können nur angemessen erschlossen – gelesen – werden, wenn die erkenntnistheoretischen Voraussetzungen und praktischen Kontexte ihrer Verwendung mit in Betracht gezogen werden.",

    "abstract": "Die Arbeit hat die Entwicklung der wissenschaftlichen Volkskunde in der Schweiz in der ersten Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts zum Thema. Der im Titel angegebene Zeitrahmen weist auf die zwei wesentlichen Spannungsfelder in der wissenschaftlichen Entwicklung der Volkskunde in der Schweiz hin: Einerseits ging es um eine fachliche und personelle Auseinandersetzung mit den Entwicklungen der Disziplin im benachbarten Deutschland, andererseits um die Postulierung einer gesellschaftlichen Relevanz in der Phase der «geistigen Landesverteidigung» und damit um den Zugang zu finanziellen Ressourcen. Diese beiden Spannungsfelder lassen sich in den folgenden Zitaten exemplarisch nachvollziehen: «Volkskundliches Interesse und volkskundliche Forschung erwuchs immer aus Kulturkrisen. Ihr stärkster Antrieb war und ist das Heimweh nach einem verlorenen Paradies, nach dem Paradies der Ursprünglichkeit, nach dem ‚einfachen Leben’.» Diese Sätze stammen aus dem Vorwort von Richard Weiss’ volkskundlichem Standwerk «Volkskunde der Schweiz» aus dem Jahr 1946 (Zitat S. 53). Weiss, eine der einflussreichsten Figuren der Schweizer Volkskunde, gab damit sowohl dem Reiz, als auch den Gefahren der jungen kulturwissenschaftlichen Disziplin Ausdruck. Die Volkskunde versprach mit einem ethnographischen Blick auf die eigene Volkskultur Erkenntnisse über die Identität und Befindlichkeit eines Volkes beziehungsweise einer Nation liefern zu können. Gleichzeitig sind in Richard Weiss’ Aussage auch zeittypische antimodernistische Reflexe und eine unverkennbare Agrarromantik zu erkennen. Weiss schrieb von «Heimweh nach dem verlorenen Paradies» und dem «einfachen Leben», das den Grundtrieb der volkskundlichen Tätigkeit ausmache, und dass am Anfang volkskundlicher Tätigkeit immer eine «Kulturkrise» stehe. Die wissenschaftliche Auseinandersetzung mit der Volkskultur wird aus der Sichtweise eines ihrer prominenten Fachvertreter also von nostalgischen Gefühlen begleitet, ein Umstand der den Vertretern des Faches ein grosses Mass an Selbstreflektion abverlangt. 1946, zum Zeitpunkt dieser Aussage von Weiss, hatte die schweizerische Gesellschaft eine «Kulturkrise» hinter sich, in der sich die Volkskunde als Orientierungswissenschaft etablieren konnte. Die gestiegene Wertschätzung der Disziplin äusserte sich nicht nur durch das Erscheinen des Standardwerks, sondern vor allem auf institutioneller Ebene. Die Veröffentlichung von Weiss’ «Volkskunde der Schweiz» kam im gleichen Jahr zustande, wie die Schaffung des ersten Lehrstuhls für Volkskunde an einer Schweizer Universität. Die Universität Zürich beschloss die bis dahin nur als Nebenfach gelehrte Disziplin in den Stand eines vollwertigen Universitätsfaches zu erheben und berief – wenig erstaunlich – Richard Weiss auf den Posten. In der Begründung des Zürcher Regierungsrates für die Schaffung des neuen Lehrstuhls lässt sich unter anderem nachlesen: «Die fortschreitende Aushöhlung und Entwertung des Echt-Volkstümlichen durch Rationalisierung und Technisierung des Lebens bedroht von innen heraus den Fortbestand der kulturellen Eigenart und Vielfalt unseres Landes und damit letztlich seine Existenz. Das Bodenständig-Schweizerische, den Quellengrund des Volkslebens, nicht nur zu erforschen, sondern zu bewahren und zu pflegen, die Festigung unseres Heimat- und Staatsbewusstseins durch die Besinnung auf die traditions- und gemeinschaftsgebundenen Kräfte, gehört zu den vornehmsten Aufgaben der Volkskunde.» (Zitiert nach: Trümpy, Hans: Volkskundliche Forschung und Lehre an den deutsch-schweizerischen Universitäten und die Schweizerische Gesellschaft für Volkskunde. In: Brückner, Wolfgang; Beitl, Klaus (Hg.): Volkskunde als akademische Disziplin. Studien zur Institutionenausbildung. Wien 1983, S. 63-77, hier S. 70-71). Diese antimodernistischen und nationalistischen Argumente des Zürcher Regierungsrates scheinen die Vorurteile gegenüber der Volkskunde als politisch instrumentalisierbare Wissenschaft zu bestätigen, stehen aber konträr zu Weiss’ reflektierter Sichtweise auf die Genese, Arbeitsweise und Funktion der Volkskunde. Weiss nimmt in seiner «Volkskunde der Schweiz» explizit und ausführlich Stellung zur Entwicklung der Disziplin und der Gefahr der politischen Instrumentalisierung und Verwässerung des wissenschaftlichen Anspruchs der Volkskunde. Diese Reflektion war in Hinblick auf die Fachentwicklung in Deutschland von grosser Bedeutung. Die Ausbildung der wissenschaftlichen Volkskunde steht in engem Zusammenhang mit dem Antimodernismus des ausgehenden 19. Jahrhunderts. Dem Verlustempfinden des «Bodenständigen» durch Modernisierung, Internationalisierung und Technisierung stand eine ausgeprägte Bewegung zur Heimatverbundenheit und der Suche nach der ursprünglichen Identität entgegen. Heimatschutz, Trachtenbewegungen und Folklore bildeten das populäre Pendant zur Formierung der wissenschaftlichen Volkskunde. Diese Entstehungsgeschichte prädestiniert die Volkskunde für Formen des aggressiveren, chauvinistischen Nationalismus des frühen 20. Jahrhunderts. Unter dem Begriff der «völkischen Wissenschaft» lässt sich eine wichtige Tendenz der Wissenschaftsentwicklung in Deutschland subsumieren. Die kulturwissenschaftliche Disziplin war nicht nur besonders offen für das Ideologiegemisch des Nationalsozialismus, sondern beteiligte sich aktiv an dessen Konstruktion. Hermann Bausinger, der wie kaum ein Anderer die wissenschaftsgeschichtliche Aufarbeitung der deutschen Volkskunde prägte, hat diese Entwicklung pointiert zusammengefasst: «Wenn irgendwo in einer Wissenschaft der Nationalsozialismus nicht als Einbruch von aussen, sondern als innere Konsequenz verstanden werden muss, dann in der Volkskunde.» (Bausinger Hermann: Volkskunde. Von der Altertumsforschung zur Kulturanalyse. Berlin, Darmstadt 1971, S. 63.). Diese Ausführungen lassen Brisanz und Dringlichkeit einer Aufarbeitung der Wissenschaftsgeschichte der Volkskunde erkennen. Dies gilt auch für den schweizerischen Kontext, gerade wenn man bedenkt, dass die Schweizerische Gesellschaft für Volkskunde (SGV) nicht nur in der Gründungsphase der wissenschaftlichen Volkskunde engen Kontakt mit den deutschen Fachkollegen pflegte, sondern dass die Kontakte bis in die 1930er Jahre besonders eng blieben und bei der Etablierung des jungen «Orchideenfachs» (Friedemann Scholl) eine entscheidende Rolle spielten.Die vorliegende Lizentiatsarbeit stellt die Geschichte der wissenschaftlichen Volkskunde in der Schweiz ab dem Beginn der «völkischen» Durchdringung des Fachdiskurses in Deutschland in den 1920er Jahren bis zur Etablierung der Disziplin als vollwertiges Universitätsfach und dem Erscheinen von Weiss’ «Volkskunde der Schweiz» in einer synchronen und diachronen Betrachtungsweise dar. Den theoretischen Rahmen bilden die wissenschaftstheoretischen Überlegungen von Mitchell Ash, der die oft einseitig dargestellte Beziehung von Wissenschaft und Politik durch den Begriff «gegenseitig mobilisierbarer Ressourcenensembles» fruchtbar ergänzt hat, sowie die Kapital-, Habitus- und Feldtheorie Pierre Bourdieus, die eine Möglichkeit bieten, den Etablierungsprozess einer Wissenschaft im gesellschaftlichen Diskurs einerseits und im wissenschaftlichen Feld andererseits zu analysieren.Den theoretisch-methodisch Überlegungen folgt eine historische Kontextualisierung der wissenschaftlichen Entwicklung im Umfeld der «geistigen Landesverteidigung» und den Fachentwicklungen in Deutschland. In einem nächsten Teil wird mit der SGV das personelle und institutionelle Netz der Volkskunde dargestellt. Prägende Personen der Schweizer Volkskunde wie Eduard Hoffmann-Krayer, Paul Geiger und Richard Weiss werden ebenso beleuchtet wie die engen fachlichen Kooperationen und Forschungsprojekte der SGV mit deutschen Fachkollegen. Eine quantitative Analyse der beiden Zeitschriften der SGV gibt Aufschluss über die Themen und Tendenzen der schweizerischen Volkskunde.Nach diesen synoptischen Darstellungen wird der Blickwinkel geändert und durch das bewusste Setzen einzelner Schwerpunkte der wissenschaftlich-methodischen Innovation der Volkskunde sowie dem Selbstverständnis und den Deutungsmustern der Akteure durch kulturgeschichtliche Methoden Rechnung getragen. Der Aspekt der wissenschaftlichen Innovation wird am Beispiel eines volkskundlichen Grossprojekts nachvollzogen, das einerseits die Chancen und Perspektiven der innovationsfreudigen Disziplin nachzeichnet und andererseits auch exemplarisch für die zunehmende Öffnung der Schweizer Volkskunde gegenüber dem helvetischen Nationalismus steht. Beim Atlas der schweizerischen Volkskunde (ASV) wurden unter widrigen Umständen und mit grossem Aufwand in der ganzen Schweiz volkskundliche Daten erhoben und kartographisch dargestellt. Die volkskundlichen Karten sollten unter anderem zeigen können, dass die schweizerische Volkskultur Sprach- und Konfessionsgrenzen überwinden vermag, und dass rassische Kategorien wissenschaftlich irrelevant sind. Der ASV verfolgte damit in der Phase der «geistigen Landesverteidigung» ein Konzept, das nicht zuletzt wissenschaftliche Argumente für die Eigenständigkeit der schweizerischen Nation liefern sollte. Dies ist besonders beachtenswert, wenn man die Vorgeschichte des ASV in die Betrachtung einbezieht. Dem schweizerischen Atlasprojekt ging eine Kooperation mit dem deutschen Vorgänger voraus, die das Ziel verfolgte, die Volkskultur des «deutschen Volkstums» kartographisch darzustellen. Der Perimeter des deutschen Projektes umfasste alle deutschsprachigen Gebiete Europas und somit auch die Schweiz, jedoch nur die deutschsprachige. Nach ersten Kooperationsversuchen zogen die Schweizer Volkskundler ihre Mitarbeit beim deutschen Atlas zurück und starteten mit dem ASV ihr eigenes Projekt. Die Genese des ASV ist nur ein interessanter Aspekt der Entwicklung der wissenschaftlichen Volkskunde in der Schweiz. Zu erwähnen wären etwa noch die Tagung des «Verbandes deutscher Vereine für Volkskunde» die 1938, während die Medien Europas über die Sudetenkrise berichteten, ausgerechnet in Basel abgehalten wurde, sowie die Jahresversammlung der SGV im helvetischen Jubiläumsjahr 1941 (650 Jahre Eidgenossenschaft), bei der die sonst der Folklore abgeneigten Volkskundler ein patriotisches Fest in der Innerschweiz inszenierten. Durch die Analyse dieser Momentaufnahmen in der Wissenschaftsgeschichte wird mit kulturgeschichtlichen Methoden das Bild der Volkskunde in der Schweiz ergänzt. Die transnational und kulturgeschichtlich orientierte Wissenschaftsgeschichte der Volkskunde in der Schweiz legt den Fokus auf die Interaktion zwischen Wissenschaft, Gesellschaft und Politik und sie zeigt auf, wie wissenschaftliche Entwicklung unabhängig von dem der Wissenschaft eigenen Objektivitätsanspruch immer in gesellschaftliche Prozesse eingebunden ist und diese aktiv mitgestaltet.",

    "abstract": "On considère en général que l’histoire de la photographie policière débute dans les années 1850 lorsque l’on effectue les premiers clichés de prisonniers, et qu’il existe à cet égard une relation étroite entre les préoccupations médicales, anthropologiques et judiciaires. L’examen respectif de l’utilisation de la photographie par les institutions carcérales et par la police révèle que le discours général sur la photographie a une influence considérablement plus importante sur l’usage qui en est fait dans les prisons. Lorsque la police judiciaire entreprit d’utiliser des photos systématiquement dans les années 1870, elle visait davantage à donner l’apparence de l’efficacité qu’à constituer un véritable instrument d’identification. Après quelques années, les collections devinrent encombrantes et ingérables. Ce problème fut résolu par Alphonse Bertillon qui introduisit un «style judiciaire» particulier de photographie dans la police. Il n’en reste pas moins que c’était d’abord un moyen destiné à figurer le caractère scientifique de la police plutôt qu’à repérer des criminels. The history of police photography is commonly believed to begin in the 1850s when the first portraits of prisoners were taken. A close relationship between medical, anthropological and judicial photography is assumed. The investigation of the photographic practices in the prison and at the police reveals that the general discourse on photography was far more important for the application of photography in penal institutions. When the criminal police began to use photographs systematically in the 1870s it was more to display effectiveness than a real means of detection. After some years of collecting, the collections became cumbersome and unmanageable. Alphonse Bertillon’s innovations solved this problem and later he introduced a specialised «judicial style» of photography into the police. Still, photographs were more important in representing scientific policing than in detecting «criminals».",

    "abstract": "Visualisation of complex datasets is often designed to assist communication and to make that data more visually accessible (Friendly and Denis, 2006). In some recent approaches to data visualisation, the goal of visualising datasets is not to reveal a single underlying ’truth’ that hides in complex data, but rather to visualise the structure of the data itself, to ’show everything’ and see what emerges (Jones, 2009). The latter approach is particularly useful in the visualisation of large digital heritage collections, which present challenges for conventional data visualisation because they are often polymorphous and idiosyncratic. Interactive tools for exploring heritage datasets can enable people to explore and play with potential relationships between parts of the collection and to learn about the collection itself and thus better understand the material it contains and how that material has been organised. This paper provides a tangible demonstration of this approach and how it has been embraced in two recent interactive heritage collection visualisation projects: Whitelaw’s Visible Archive (which visualises the collection of the National Archives of Australia) and Hinton and Whitelaw’s Flickr Commons Explorer (which visualises nearly 40 photographic collections comprising more than 20,000 images available through Flickr).",

    "abstract": "Digitalisierung von Kulturgut steht bei Bibliotheken hoch im Kurs. Doch da die entstehenden digitalen Sammlungen meist nicht im Volltext durchsuchbar sind, bleiben sie in ihrer Nutzbarkeit beschränkt. Druckwerke können durch OCR erschlossen werden, doch die elektronisch erzeugten Texte sind trotz allem technischen Fortschritt nach wie vor nicht fehlerfrei. Für Handschriften kommt weiterhin meist nur die Transkription durch menschliche Bearbeiter in Frage. Durch Crowdsourcing werden die Nutzer an der Erstellung und Korrektur von Volltexten beteiligt. Dieser Artikel stellt drei Beispiel unterschiedlicher Größe und Zielsetzung zur Erschließung von Zeitungsbeständen und neuzeitlichen Autographen durch freiwillige Beiträger vor. Er argumentiert, dass Crowdsourcing für die Erschließung historischer Bibliotheksbestände geeignet ist und sich durch die aktive Beteiligung der Nutzer ein Mehrwert für beide Seiten ergibt.",

    "abstract": "We report on our user study on the information seeking behavior of cultural heritage experts and the sources they use to carry out search tasks. Seventeen experts from nine cultural heritage institutes in the Netherlands were interviewed and asked to answer questionnaires about their daily search activities. The interviews helped us to better understand their search motivations, types, sources and tools. A key finding of our study is that the majority of search tasks involve relatively complex information gathering. This is in contrast to the relatively simple fact-finding oriented support provided by current tools. We describe a number of strategies that experts have developed to overcome the inadequacies of their tools. Finally, based on the analysis, we derive general trends of cultural heritage experts’ information seeking needs and discuss our preliminary experiences with potential solutions.",

    "abstract": "An empirical investigation of information retrieval (IR) using the MEDLINE1 database was carried out to study user behaviour, performance and to investigate the reasons for suboptimal searches. The experimental subjects were drawn from two groups of final year medical students who differed in their knowledge of the search system (i.e., novice and expert users). The subjects carried out four search tasks and their recall and precision performance was recorded. Data was captured on the search strategies used, duration, and logs of submitted queries. Differences were found between the groups for the performance measure of recall in only one of the four experimental tasks. Overall performance was poor. Analysis of strategies, timing data, and query logs showed that there were many different causes for search failure or success. Poor searchers either gave up too quickly, employed few search terms, used only simple queries, or used the wrong search terms. Good searchers persisted longer, used a larger, richer set of terms, constructed more complex queries, and were more diligent in evaluating the retrieved results. However, individual performances were not correlated with all of these factors. Poor performers frequently exhibited several factors of good searcher behaviour and failed for just one reason. Overall end-user searching behaviour is complex and it seems that just one factor can cause poor performance, whereas good performance can result from suboptimal strategies that compensate for some difficulties. The implications of the results for the design of IR interfaces are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Kunstwissenschaftler/innen, die mit informatischen Methoden an kunsthistorischen Gegenständen und Fragestellungen arbeiten, stehen zwar in regem Austausch, aber insbesondere beim Arbeiten mit digitalen Bildern bestehen noch erhebliche Probleme des allgemeinen Austauschs und der Verbindung von Forschungs- und Bilddaten. Zwar haben sich einzelne Zentren etabliert, die sich als Anbieter von Bildmaterial um Integration bemühen– etwa Foto Marburg und prometheus –, doch verwalten diese Institutionen nur einen Teil des digitalen Bildmaterials, das die Forschung benötigt. Techniken und Methoden, mit denen Bild- und Quellenmaterial auf elektronischem Wege wissenschaftlich verarbeitet wird, sind heterogen und zum Teil noch unausgereift. Das Gleiche gilt für die digitale Publikation der Forschungsresultate und –rohdaten. Von einer ernst zu nehmenden „digitalen Kunstgeschichte“ kann daher noch kaum geredet werden. Das ganze Potential der digitalen Technologie wird erst dann nutzbar, wenn eine kritische Masse des historischen Materials online verfügbar, gemeinsam bearbeitbar und für die Öffentlichkeit sichtbar ist. Das setzt ein reibungsloses Zusammenwirken von digitalen Werkzeugen, Datenformaten und Schnittstellen voraus. Darin liegt der Schlüssel zu einer digitalen Kunstgeschichte, die sich auf dem Gebiet der „digital humanities“ dynamisch etabliert und emanzipiert. Am 18. Oktober 2013 kam in Marburg ein Kreis von im deutschsprachigen Raum tätigen Wissenschaftler/innen zusammen, um diese Aufgaben zu diskutieren",

    "abstract": "This research examines the pattern of Web information seeking in four groups of nurses with different combinations of domain expertise and Web expertise. Protocols were gathered as the nurses carried out information-seeking tasks in the domain of osteoporosis. Domain and Web novices searched breadth-first and did little or no evaluation of the results. Domain expert/Web novices also searched breadth-first but evaluated information more thoroughly using osteoporosis knowledge. Domain novice/Web experts searched in a mixed, breadth-first/depth-first pattern and attempted to evaluate information using general criteria. Domain expert/Web experts carried out depth-first searches, following deep trails of information and evaluated information based on the most varied and sophisticated criteria. The results suggest that there are distinct differences in searching patterns related to expertise. Implications of these findings and suggestions for future research are provided.",

    "abstract": "The main objective of this paper was to investigate the effects of a computer screen interface design and its related geometrical characteristics of 36 graphical objects on a user’s task efficiency. A total of 490 subjects took part in laboratory experiments that focused on the direct manipulation of a visual dialogue between a user and a computer. The subjects were asked to select an object from among a group of items randomly placed on the computer screen that were visible exclusively during the visual search process. A model expressing the mean object acquisition time as a function of graphical object size and the configuration was developed and statistically validated. The model showed an influence of geometrical design characteristics of the graphical objects (icons) and their groupings (icon structures) on the observed task efficiency. The reported results can be used at those stages of a software lifecycle that concentrate on prototyping, designing, and implementing graphical solutions for the efficient graphical user–computer interface.",

    "abstract": "The paper explores visualisation of “big data” from digitised museum collections and archives, focusing on the relationship between data, visualisation and narrative. A contrast is presented between visualisations that show “just the data” and those that present the information in such a way as to tell a story using visual rhetorical devices; such devices have historically included trees, streams, chains, geometric shapes and other forms. The contrast is explored through historical examples and a survey of current practice. A discussion centred on visualising datasets from the British Library, Science Museum and Wellcome Library is used to outline key research questions.",

    "abstract": "Humanities Computing gave rise to the Digital Humanities, which brought considerations of a wider scope of the digital turn to humanities research. Increasingly, the area is understood to include the field of design, exemplified by definitions that describe the Digital Humanities as a “generative enterprise”. We suggest that design contributes not only to the making of digital artefacts. Design practiced with the aim to generate new knowledge constitues a research method. Design research contributes to the Digital Humanities expertise in addressing complex problems and methods for making the knowledge that is generated during a design process explicit.",

    "abstract": "Rapid expansion in the digitization of image and image collections has vastly increased the numbers of images available to scholars and researchers through electronic means. This research review will familiarize the reader with current research applicable to the development of image retrieval systems and provides additional material for exploring the topic further, both in print and online. The discussion will cover several broad areas, among them classification and indexing systems used for describing image collections and research initiatives into image access focusing on image attributes, users, queries, tasks, and cognitive aspects of searching. Prospects for the future of image access, including an outline of future research initiatives, are discussed. Further research in each of these areas will provide basic data which will inform and enrich image access system design and will hopefully provide a richer, more flexible, and satisfactory environment for searching for and discovering images. Harnessing the true power of the digital image environment will only be possible when image retrieval systems are coherently designed from principles derived from the fullest range of applicable disciplines, rather than from isolated or fragmented perspectives.",

    "abstract": "Die Entwicklung digitaler Werkzeuge lässt sich als wichtiger Teilbereich in den Digital Humanities identifizieren (Davis und Kräutli 2015; Schnapp et al. 2009). Entsprechende Forschung und Projektarbeit steht dabei komplexen Herausforderungen gegenüber. Nicht nur die Frage nach verfügbaren Daten, methodologischer Fundierung und technologischer Umsetzbarkeit, sondern auch die Frage nach deren langfristigen Verfügbarmachung sind wiederkehrende Themen der letzten Jahre. Eine zentrale Rolle für die Sicherstellung von Qualität und Anwendbarkeit der digitalen Werkzeuge ist die Einbindung von Forscher_innen der jeweiligen geisteswissenschaftlichen Disziplinen im Entwicklungsprozess (Drucker 2013). Gleichzeitig lässt sich die zentrale Bedeutung von Interfacedesign, Nutzungsanleitungen und Benutzerfreundlichkeit als wichtige Faktoren für die Etablierung von digitalen Werkzeugen im Forschungsprozess feststellen (Gibbs und Owens 2012). Doch selbst wenn diese Herausforderungen bewältigt werden und ein digitales Werkzeug (erfolgreich) entwickelt wurde, stellt sich weiterhin die Frage, wie die langfristige Nachnutzung im Sinne einer digitalen Nachhaltigkeit sichergestellt werden kann. Am Beispiel des Entstehungsprozesses einer sammlungsspezifischen Visualisierung und deren Weiterentwicklung zu einem nachnutzbaren Werkzeug werden einige zentrale Aspekte der beeinflussenden Faktoren und Lösungsansätze vorgestellt. Unser Beitrag stellt sich somit der Frage, wie sichergestellt werden kann, dass digitale Tools auch über die Laufzeit von Förderprojekten hinaus (und unabhängig von spezifischen Use-cases) dauerhaft nutzbar und weiterentwickelbar sind.",

Visualisierungen können einen offenen und explorativen Zugang zu den digitalisierten Beständen bieten, der eher den Ausstellungs- und Vermittlungsaktivitäten des Museums entspricht oder diese ergänzt. Dabei werden die Potenziale der digitalen Präsentation herausgearbeitet und Anhand von Use Cases aus der Forschung illustriert, welche Ansätze in der facettierten und \"kuratierten\" Inszenierung von Sammlungen umgesetzt werden können.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, access to cultural heritage has been closely connected to digitisation. We argue the case for recognising this digital shift as an opportunity to create interfaces to cultural heritage that are, first of all, more inviting to the public. Secondly, we want to encourage critical approaches towards the representation of cultural production and allow for alternative or even conflicting narratives and interpretations to surface. We present related work, use cases, and concepts for visualisations and interfaces that invite the reconsideration of modes of categorisation, presentation and clustering. Our intent is to develop ways to scrutinise modes of exclusion, carry out critical evaluations and pursue interventional strategies. We discuss the specific potential of visualisation, annotation and dynamic expansion of digital cultural collections. Building on critical approaches in human-computer interaction, visualisation and cultural theories, we explore how the interface could be a means of reflection, critique and inclusion.",

    "abstract": "Museen erweitern ihr Vermittlungsangebot immer mehr über die physische Einrichtung hinaus, u.a. durch die Bereitstellung Digitaler Sammlungen im Web. Digitale Sammlungen zeichnen sich dadurch aus, dass die in ihnen gezeigten Objekte speziell für das Web aufbereitet und präsentiert werden. Der Anspruch besteht dabei darin, die Gesamtheit der musealen Sammlungen zur Verfügung zu stellen. Um diese umfassenden Datensätze zugänglich und ein Schlendern durch die Bestände zu ermöglichen, wird innerhalb der Digitalen Sammlungen zunehmend ein sogenannter Explore-Modus angeboten. Auf der Basis einer Untersuchung des Begriffes der Exploration wurden im Rahmen dieser Arbeit acht bekannte Museen im Hinblick auf die Explore-Modi ihrer Digitalen Sammlungen miteinander verglichen und analysiert. Es wurde eine dreiteilige Methode mit dem Namen Reverse Information Architecture entwickelt, um die folgende Frage zu beantworten: Wie manifestiert sich die Funktion der Exploration in der Struktur und den Interface-Elementen der Digitalen Sammlungen? Mit der entwickelten Methode wird der Inhalt der Websites analysiert, um zu untersuchen, inwiefern Konzepte der Exploration in den Digitalen Sammlungen umgesetzt werden.",

    "abstract": "Network visualization deals with all aspects of representing relational structures. The automatic generation of network visualizations is of relevance not only in computer science, but in virtually every area concerned with graphical data analysis or visual communication of information. For more than 10 years, network visualization also known as graph drawing is an established research field of its own. It encompasses design and analysis of algorithms and algorithm engineering, as well as modelling aspects, topics from graph theory and combinatorics, and the development of sofware tools. This article gives an overview of the main methodological contributions of the field.",

    "abstract": "We report the results of a British Library Research and Development Department‐funded design study for an interactive information retrieval system which will determine structural representations of the anomalous states of knowledge (ASKs) underlying information needs, and attempt to resolve the anomalies through a variety of retrieval strategies performed on a database of documents represented in compatible structural formats. Part I discusses the background to the project and the theory underlying it, Part II (next issue) presents our methods, results and conclusions. Basic premises of the project were: that information needs are not in principle precisely specifiable; that it is possible to elicit problem statements from information system users from which representations of the ASK underlying the need can be derived; that there are classes of ASKs; and, that all elements of information retrieval systems ought to be based on the user’s ASK. We have developed a relatively freeform interview technique for eliciting problem statements, and a statistical word co‐occurrence analysis for deriving network representations of the problem statements and abstracts. Structural characteristics of the representations have been used to determine classes of ASKs, and both ASK and information structures have been evaluated by, respectively, users and authors. Some results are: that interviewing appears to be a satisfactory technique for eliciting problem statements from which ASKs can be determined; that the statistical analysis produces structures which are generally appropriate both for documents and problem statements; that ASKs thus represented can be usefully classified according to their structural characteristics; and, that of thirty‐five subjects, only two had ASKs for which traditional “best match” retrieval would be intuitively appropriate. The results of the design study indicate that at least some of our premises are reasonable, and that an ASK‐based information retrieval system is at least feasible.",

    "abstract": "At present, Spain is a good example for a state between separatism and transnationalisation. Spain takes part in the European integration process, while its national unity is doubted by various peripheral nationalisms that developed from the second half of the 19th century on, like for example the catalanism. In this context Catalan, Spanish and European identity become increasingly contested and ideologized. Maps have a central function in the discursive (re-)construction of these spatial identities, because they are the most important way to perceive larger spaces. This article illustrates how maps of an everyday context (in schoolbooks, weather forecast etc.) contribute and did contribute to form several geographical and territorial images of Europe, Spain and Catalonia in a diachronic overview from the point of view of a critical cartography. Seen from a critical perspective maps don’t represent a ’reality’ in an objectivistic way. They rather form a genre of visual texts with its own ’grammatical’ rules of production and reading which is embedded in a wider societal discourse.",

Dieser Aspekt ist zu beachten, wenn es um die Verschiebung hin zum so genannten post-fotografischen Zeitalter geht. Denn die Digitalisierung verändert die Fotografie besonders hinsichtlich der Verlagerung von der Speicherung zur Übertragung, was in verschiedenen künstlerischen Ansätzen reflektiert wird.",

    "abstract": "Medien und Kommunikation befinden sich im andauernden Umbruch. Damit einher gehen Wechselbewegungen zwischen Komplexität und Vereinfachung in den Gegenstandsfeldern sowie in den Ansätzen und Methoden der Kommunikationswissenschaft und Medienforschung. Informationsangebote vielfältigen sich in ihrer Zahl, vereinheitlichen sich aber inhaltlich. Medienhandeln nimmt einerseits sehr unterschiedliche Formen an, bewegt sich andererseits aber innerhalb einer überschaubaren Zahl von Kommunikationsmodi und Plattformen. Medienorganisationen differenzieren sich zum einen aus und fusionieren zum anderen miteinander. Ebenso gehört der Umgang mit zunehmenden Handlungsoptionen in algorithmisch sortierten Angeboten, mit wachsenden Kreisen potentieller Interaktionspartner als auch mit vorstrukturierten Kommunikationsmustern zur alltäglichen Erfahrung. Der Wunsch, die Bedingungen, Prozesse und Konsequenzen solcher kommunikativen Vorgänge und medialen Strukturveränderungen in ihrer Komplexität erfassen zu wollen, um ihre Varianz und Variabilität adäquat abzubilden und zu verstehen, führt zu Komplikationen in analytischer, methodischer und forschungspraktischer Hinsicht. Es scheint, als ob eine Beschränkung der zu betrachtenden Aspekte und zu untersuchenden Sachverhalte notwendig sei. Der Band setzt sich mit diesem grundlegenden, doch heute aktueller denn je erscheinenden Spannungsfeld der Kommunikationsforschung und Medienanalyse auseinander. Er versammelt dazu analytische Zugänge und konkrete empirische Studien, um mediale Prozesse und kommunikatives Handeln zwischen Komplexitätszunahme und Komplexitätsreduktion zu bestimmen.",

Qualitative Forschung ist keine beliebig einsetzbare Technik, sondern eine Grundhaltung, ein Denkstil, der immer streng am Gegenstand orientiert ist. Das Buch stellt Bezüge zum Gegenstandsfeld her und möchte einer Trennung zwischen Gegenstandsspezialisten und Methodenspezialisten entgegenwirken. Es bietet Unterstützung bei der Überprüfung der Aussagekraft von Projekten und deren Methodik. Aus dem Inhalt: 1. Geschichte qualitativen Denkens 2. Theorie qualitativen Denkens 3. Untersuchungspläner qualitativer Forschung 4. Verfahren qualitativer Analyse 5. Computereinsatz in der qualitaitven Sozialforschung 6. Gütekriterien qualitaitver Forschung 7.

    "abstract": "Die Entwicklung dessen, was wir immer häufiger mit visueller Kultur bezeichnen, ist wesentlich mit der Durchsetzung visueller Medien verbunden, insbesondere der Fotografie. Sie hat seit ihrer Erfindung in allen gesellschaftlichen Bereichen Funktionen übernommen, und sie ist heute das basale Medium der neuen Bildmedien. Die technischen Bilder sind nicht nur im öffentlichen Raum omnipräsent, sondern ebenso im privaten, und beinahe jeder ist nun selbst Bildproduzent. Angesichts dieser Entwicklungen wird der theoretische Diskurs in den Erziehungswissenschaften über die Bedeutung des Visuellen für das Aufwachsen und die Bildung ebenso schmerzlich vermisst wie methodische Zugänge zur Erschließung visueller Quellen. Die hier vorgelegte Arbeit macht es sich vor diesem Hintergrund zur Aufgabe, Fotografie als Medium in ihrer Bedeutung für die erziehungswissenschaftliche Forschung hervorzuheben und damit den Diskurs um das Visuelle in Erziehungsverhältnissen zu beleben und um die fotografische Perspektive zu erweitern. Es werden methodologische Grundlagen für einen quellenkritischen Umgang geschaffen und Standards für die Auswertung von (fotografischen) Bildern entwickelt, die ebenso für sozialwissenschaftliche und historische Untersuchungen gelten. Dabei werden die indexikalischen und ästhetischen Qualitäten der Fotografie unter der Prämisse der sozialen Praxis des Fotografierens und der spezifischen Produktions-, Distributions- und Rezeptionsverhältnisse des (technischen) Massenmediums gewürdigt.

    "abstract": "Digitalisierung macht Geschichte: Öffentliche Institutionen übernehmen vermehrt Fotobestände von Bildagenturen und codieren sie zu historischen Kulturgütern um. Doch das ist bloss das vorläufige Ende eines vielschichtigen historischen Prozesses. Basierend auf einer historischen Ethnografie des Fotoarchivs des Schweizer Ringier-Verlags geraten Akteuren, archivarische Praktiken und institutionelle Logiken unter die Lupe. Sie geben den mannigfaltigen Digitalisierungsprozessen von Fotografien seit den 1970er-Jahren Kontur. Dabei wird in verschiedenen historisch-medialen Konstellationen deutlich, wie und mit welchen Beweggründen Bilder an Geschichte geknüpft worden sind. Der Fall Ringier ermöglicht so zugleich eine praxeologische Reflexion über das Verhältnis von Fotografie, Archiv und Geschichte",

Der Text und das Bild werden nicht mehr nur im Archiv abgelegt als ›Akte‹, sondern sie werden selber auch zum ›Akteur‹.

Therefore it addresses many facets of research in a network environment like persistence of information, long-time preservation and accessibility, digital documentation standards or e-publishing.

    "abstract": "The pulp and paper industry accounts for approximately 5% of total industrial energy consumption and contributes 2% of direct carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from industries. World paper and paperboard demand and production are increasing significantly, leading to an increase in this sector’s energy use and CO2 emissions. Although current studies identify a wide range of energy-efficiency technologies that have already been commercialized for the pulp and paper industry, information is limited or scattered regarding new energy-efficiency technologies that are not yet fully commercialized. Development of emerging or advanced energy-efficiency technologies and their deployment in the market will be crucial for this industry’s mid- and long-term energy saving and climate change mitigation strategies. This paper compiles available information on energy savings, environmental and other benefits, costs, and commercialization status for 25 emerging technologies to reduce the energy use and CO2 emissions. The purpose is to provide a well-structured comprehensive review on these emerging energy-efficiency technologies for engineers, researchers, investors, policy makers, pulp and/or paper companies, and other interested parties.

We describe the current situation and the need for improvement in order to describe in full detail the steps undertaken to create a Swiss-wide model. A case study was undertaken by using several data sets from the domains of art and design in the context of the ICOPAD project. We provide a set of recommendations to enable a PID service that could mint Archival Resource Key (ARK) identifiers as complement to Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). We conclude with some remarks concerning the transferability of this approach to other areas and the requirements for a national hub for PID management in Switzerland.",

    "abstract": "Persistent Identifier (PIDs) are a necessary tool to assure referenceability and - as their name says - identifiability in a bi-unique manner upon which further mechanisms can be built upon, e.g. citability to mention only the probably most important one. Their persistence is a real added value compared to the cool URIs of the Linked Data approach which is not in opposition to a joint use of both PIDs and Linked Data. Currently, the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is prominently used in Switzerland, which is attributed since 2010 by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zürich (ETH). The PID service is used for documents and data and only free of charge for the scientists working for the ETH; a constraint which can be seen for the inhibited use of the service. For this reason, ICOPAD (= Identités de confiance pour les données de l’art et du design) started in 2017 to reflect on a suitable PID model for the Swiss scientific landscape, specifying all necessary requirements and workflows with a Linked Open Data (LOD) perspective. ICOPAD is a joint project between four Swiss institutions (namely the HEG Geneva as instigator and managing authority; SIK-ISEA, the Zurich Central Library as well as the Zurich School of Art and Design) who already worked together successfully in a previous project on Linked Data for Art and Design in Zurich (LOD-Z). The goal of ICOPAD is to work out all details underlying the need to loosen the dependency from cool URIs and to give an exemplary showcase that proves the structural feasibility of this approach dedicated to the disciplines of art, design, and digital humanities. After the period of data exploration, a modelling process started with the axiom-like assertion that the DOI-only approach followed so far in Switzerland is not sufficient which lead to the conclusion that a complement must be found. It was decided to opt for a solution that combines both approaches and creates a link both to the cool URIs of the Linked Data world as well as to all other PIDs.",

This white paper, called \"Suggested measures for deploying IIIF in Swiss cultural heritage institutions\", is based on several use-cases and gives tips as well as step-by-step recommendations on which software to deploy or which Community and Technical Specification Groups to contact. For instance, some of the case studies that have been selected are: A platform of digital surrogates wishing to comply with the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) A scholar keen on creating its own IIIF Manifests IIIF at the heart of a rich navigation experience for newspapers Dissemination of audiovisual resources through IIIF This lighthing talk will aim to show the most important results of the TICKS project, provide information on how to better promote IIIF implementation. The presentation will also consider how the white paper can be maintained and improved with the help of the wider IIIF community and how it could be transferred to other scientific communities or regions of the world.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, museums, archives and other cultural institutions have initiated important programs to digitize their collections. Millions of artefacts (paintings, engravings, drawings, ancient photographs) are now represented in digital photographic format. Furthermore, through progress in standardization, a growing portion of these images are now available online, in an easily accessible manner. This thesis studies how such large-scale art history collection can be made searchable using new deep learning approaches for processing and comparing images. It takes as a case study the processing of the photo archive of the Foundation Giorgio Cini, where more than 300’000 images have been digitized. We demonstrate how a generic processing pipeline can reliably extract the visual and textual content of scanned images, opening up ways to efficiently digitize large photo-collections. Then, by leveraging an annotated graph of visual connections, a metric is learnt that allows clustering and searching through artwork reproductions independently of their medium, effectively solving a difficult problem of cross-domain image search. Finally, the thesis studies how a complex Web Interface allows users to perform different searches based on this metric. We also evaluate the process by which users can annotate elements of interest during their navigation to be added to the database, allowing the system to be trained further and give better results. By documenting a complete approach on how to go from a physical photo-archive to a state-of-the-art navigation system, this thesis paves the way for a global search engine across the world’s photo archives.

    "abstract": "In the World Wide Web, a very large number of resources is made available through digital libraries. The existence of many individual digital libraries, maintained by different organizations, brings challenges to the discoverability, sharing and reuse of the resources. A widely-used approach is metadata aggregation, where centralized efforts like Europeana facilitate the discoverability and use of the resources by collecting their associated metadata. The cultural heritage domain embraced the aggregation approach while, at the same time, the technological landscape kept evolving. Nowadays, cultural heritage institutions are increasingly applying technologies designed for the wider interoperability on the Web. This paper presents a study of the current application by cultural heritage data providers of technological solutions in use for making structured metadata available for re-use in the Internet. We investigated the use of both linked data and technologies related with indexing of resources by Internet search engines. We have conducted a harvesting experiment of the landing pages from websites of digital libraries that participate in Europeana, and collected statistics about the usage these particular technologies. These technologies allow for representing structured data within HTML, or for structured data to be referred to by links within HTML or through HTTP headers capabilities. We conclude with a discussion of future work for establishing a solution for cultural heritage aggregation based on the current situation and the available technologies.",

The cultural heritage domain embraced the aggregation approach while, at the same time, the technological landscape kept evolving. Nowadays, cultural heritage institutions are increasingly applying technologies designed for the wider interoperability on the Web. In this context, we have identified the Schema.org vocabulary as a potential technology for innovating metadata aggregation. We conducted two case studies that analysed Schema.org metadata from collections from cultural heritage institutions. We used the requirements of the Europeana Network as evaluation criteria. These include the recommendations of the Europeana Data Model, which is a collaborative effort from all the domains represented in Europeana: libraries, museums, archives, and galleries. We concluded that Schema.org poses no obstacle that cannot be overcome to allow data providers to deliver metadata in full compliance with Europeana requirements and with the desired semantic quality. However, Schema.org’s cross-domain applicability raises the need for accompanying its adoption by recommendations and/or specifications regarding how data providers should create their Schema.org metadata, so that they can meet the specific requirements of Europeana or other cultural aggregation networks.",
