# Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD)

A summary page about LOUD, page in construction...

The Semantic Web, with its use of Resource Description Framework (RDF) graphs, offers significant potential for data modelling and reasoning, but faces challenges in terms of query complexity, data handling, and visualisation. Despite these obstacles, the advent of JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data (JSON-LD) represents a notable advance, providing a flexible data representation that addresses some of these issues by allowing dual treatment as both JSON and a graph.

## LOUD Design Principles

One of the main purposes of LOUD is to make the data more easily accessible to software developers, who play a key role in interacting with the data and building software and services on top of it, and to some extent to academics. As such, striking a delicate balance between the dual imperatives of data completeness and accuracy, which depend on the underlying ontological construct, and the pragmatic considerations of scalability and usability, becomes imperative. 

Similar to Tim-Berners Lee's [Five Star Open Data Deployment Scheme](https://5stardata.info/), Robert Sanderson listed [five design principles that underpin LOUD](https://linked.art/loud/):

1. The right Abstraction for the audience
2. Few Barriers to entry
3. Comprehensible by introspection
4. Documentation with working examples
5. Few Exceptions, instead many consistent patterns

## LOUD Standards

Three systems adhering to the LOUD design principles have been identified:

- International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) 
- Web Annotation Data Model
- Linked Art 

### IIIF

[IIIF](https://iiif.io) is both a model for presenting and annotating content as well as a global community that develops shared application programming interfaces (APIs), implements them in software, and exposes interoperable content.

### Web Annotation Data Model

The [Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) is a W3C standard that provides an extensible and interoperable framework for creating and sharing annotations across various platforms. It defines relationships between resources using an RDF graph, which includes the `annotation`, a web resource, the `body`, and the `target`. This model allows a single comment to be associated with multiple resources.

Here is an example of machine-generated annotations in a IIIF setting. The JSON-LD snippet represents an `AnnotationPage` that contains one or more annotations related to a particular IIIF resource.

```json
{
  "@context": "http://iiif.io/api/presentation/3/context.json",
  "id": "https://iiif.participatory-archives.ch/annotations/SGV_12N_08589-p1-list.json",
  "type": "AnnotationPage",
  "items": [
    {
      "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld",
      "id": "https://iiif.participatory-archives.ch/annotations/SGV_12N_08589-p1-list/annotation-436121.json",
      "motivation": "commenting",
      "type": "Annotation",
      "body": [
        {
          "type": "TextualBody",
          "value": "person",
          "purpose": "commenting"
        },
        {
          "type": "TextualBody",
          "value": "Object Detection (vitrivr)",
          "purpose": "tagging"
        },
        {
          "type": "TextualBody",
          "value": "<br><small>Detection score: 0.9574</small>",
          "purpose": "commenting"
        }
      ],
      "target": {
        "source": "https://iiif.participatory-archives.ch/SGV_12N_08589/canvas/p1",
        "selector": {
          "type": "FragmentSelector",
          "conformsTo": "http://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/",
          "value": "xywh=319,2942,463,523"
        },
        "dcterms:isPartOf": {
          "type": "Manifest",
          "id": "https://iiif.participatory-archives.ch/SGV_12N_08589/manifest.json"
        }}},
```

### Linked Art

[Linked Art](https://linked.art) is a community and a CIDOC ([ICOM International Committee for Documentation](https://cidoc.mini.icom.museum/)) Working Group collaborating to define a metadata application profile for describing cultural heritage, and the technical means for conveniently interacting with it.
