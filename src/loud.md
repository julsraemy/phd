# Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD)

A summary page about LOUD, page in construction...

## LOUD Design Principles

One of the main purposes of LOUD is to make the data more easily accessible to software developers, who play a key role in interacting with the data and building software and services on top of it, and to some extent to academics. As such, striking a delicate balance between the dual imperatives of data completeness and accuracy, which depend on the underlying ontological construct, and the pragmatic considerations of scalability and usability, becomes imperative. 

Similar to Tim-Berners Lee's <a href="https://5stardata.info/en/" target="_blank">Five Star Open Data Deployment Scheme</a>, Robert Sanderson listed <a href="https://linked.art/loud/" target="_blank">five design principles that underpin LOUD</a>:

1. The right Abstraction for the audience
2. Few Barriers to entry
3. Comprehensible by introspection
4. Documentation with working examples
5. Few Exceptions, instead many consistent patterns
