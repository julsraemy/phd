      "content_html": "LOUD for Cultural Heritage – PhD Thesis by Julien A. Raemy “Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) for Cultural Heritage&quot; not only encapsulates the essence of my PhD thesis, but also reflects a passion, as I have been actively involved in both the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) and the Linked Art communities for many years. It describes a vision where cultural heritage institutions and beyond actively cultivate collaboration and enthusiastically embrace community-driven standards that enable semantic interoperability. In cases where implementation of the standards may not be feasible, I advocate that institutions consider adopting LOUD design principles as essential socio-technical practices. An HTML version of my thesis will be accessible on this site upon its completion, while the research outcomes associated with my PhD can also be found here. If you just want to know more about LOUD, I've written a summary about its design principles and community-driven standards. Context My journey into the Digital Humanities Lab of the University of Basel began as an undergraduate in Information Science, undertaking an internship that spanned from August to October 2016. This period marked the start of my deep involvement with the IIIF community, a pivotal step that would significantly shape my academic and research pursuits. The experience gained during this internship not only provided me with a solid foundation in Digital Humanities but also sparked my interest in leveraging linked open data and standardised application programming interfaces (APIs) for cultural heritage preservation and accessibility. It was within one of these stimulating environments that I found the inspiration and support needed to embark on a doctoral journey, starting my PhD in February 2021. The thesis is grounded as part of the SNSF-funded Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA) research project (2021-2025), a four-year interdisciplinary effort, which aims to develop a Citizen Science platform around three photographic collections from the archives of Cultural Anthropology Switzerland (CAS), formerly the Swiss Society for Folklore Studies, i.e. the Atlas of Swiss Folklore (SGV_05), Kreis Family (SGV_10), and Ernst Brunner (SGV_12). The research project is led by the University of Basel (Institute for Cultural Anthropology and European Ethnology as well as the Digital Humanities Lab) and the Bern Academy of the Arts (HKB). There is more information about the PIA research project and my involvement therein on a dedicated page.

LOUD Design Principles One of the main purposes of LOUD is to make the data more easily accessible to software developers, who play a key role in interacting with the data and building software and services on top of it, and to some extent to academics. As such, striking a delicate balance between the dual imperatives of data completeness and accuracy, which depend on the underlying ontological construct, and the pragmatic considerations of scalability and usability, becomes imperative. Similar to Tim-Berners Lee's Five Star Open Data Deployment Scheme, Robert Sanderson listed five design principles that underpin LOUD: The right Abstraction for the audience Few Barriers to entry Comprehensible by introspection Documentation with working examples Few Exceptions, instead many consistent patterns LOUD Standards International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF), Linked Art, Web Annotation Data Model",

In addition, contributions were made through the publication of articles in peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings, as well as writing a book chapter. Further essential activities included developing scripts for data collection and analysis, building data pipeline workflows, and designing and implementing data models, with a particular emphasis on using Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) standards such as Linked Art, a metadata application profile for describing cultural heritage.

Two research axes or perspectives have been identified to investigate LOUD, the first axis focusing on community practices, i.e. assessing the mechanisms by which organisations, individuals and apparatuses are entangled in consensus-making, and the second on semantic interoperability, i.e. how to make data meaningful to machines in a standardised and interoperable manner. This work is grounded as part of the SNSF-funded research project Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA), which aims to develop a citizen science platform around three photographic collections from the archives of Cultural Anthropology Switzerland (CAS), formerly the Swiss Society for Folklore Studies. The theoretical framework is firmly rooted in Actor-Network Theory (ANT), a constructivist approach mainly defined by Bruno Latour, as one of the objectives is to describe the associations between actors and the social fabrics of the LOUD ecosystem as well as to highlight the importance of non-human actors, such as the data models developed in the context of the PIA research project. Additionally, the theoretical framework is enriched by integrating complementary perspectives from Anna Haraway's Situated Knowledges, Susan Leigh Star's Boundary Objects, and Luciano Floridi's Philosophy of Information. Each of these frameworks contributes uniquely to our understanding of LOUD and its socio-technical landscape. Overall, this doctoral thesis aims to contribute to the understanding of LOUD and their adoption within cultural heritage institutions. By investigating community practices and semantic interoperability, this research seeks to identify and address challenges and provide insights into how LOUD can be effectively used for the description and dissemination of cultural heritage resources, taking into account all the human and non-human entities needed to develop those standards and to learn from it in the broader cultural heritage field. Moreover, this research aims to recognise the evolution of community practices and the potential bias of a western-centred view. The empirical part of the research is not limited to the implementation of the LOUD standards within the PIA research project, it also comprises an analysis of the social fabrics of the IIIF and Linked Art communities, and an investigation of LUX, Yale Collections Discovery platform.
