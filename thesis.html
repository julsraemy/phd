    <meta name="description" content="Digital technologies have fundamentally transformed how Cultural Heritage (CH) collections are accessed and engaged with. Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) specifications, including the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) Presentation API 3.0, Linked Art, and the Web Annotation Data Model (WADM), have emerged as web standards to facilitate the description and dissemination of these valuable resources. Despite the widespread adoption of IIIF, implementing LOUD specifications, particularly in combination, remains challenging. This is especially evident in the development and assessment of infrastructures, or sites of assemblage, that support these standards.
This research is guided by two perspectives: community practices and semantic interoperability. The first perspective assesses how organizations, individuals, and apparatuses engage with and contribute to the consensus-making processes surrounding LOUD. By examining these practices, the social fabrics of the LOUD ecosystem can be better understood. The second perspective focuses on making data meaningful to machines in a standardized, interoperable manner that promotes the exchange of well-formed information. This research is grounded in the SNSF-funded project, *Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives* (PIA) (2021–2025), which aims to develop a citizen science platform for three photographic collections from the Cultural Anthropology Switzerland (CAS) archives. Actor-Network Theory (ANT) forms the theoretical foundation, aiming to describe the collaborative structures of the LOUD ecosystem and emphasize the role of non-human actors.
Beyond its implementation within the PIA project, this research includes an analysis of the social dynamics within the IIIF and Linked Art communities and an investigation of Yale's Collections Discovery platform, LUX. The research identifies socio-technical requirements for developing specifications aligned with LOUD principles. It also examines how the implementation of LOUD standards in PIA highlights their potential benefits and limitations in facilitating data reuse and broader participation. Additionally, it explores Yale University's large-scale deployment of LOUD standards, emphasizing the importance of ensuring consistency between Linked Art and IIIF resources within the LUX platform for the CH domain.
The core methodology of this thesis is an actor- and practice-centered inquiry, focusing on a detailed examination of specific cosmologies within LOUD-driven communities, PIA, and LUX. This micro-perspective approach provides rich empirical evidence to unravel the intricate web of cultural processes and constellations in these contexts.
Key empirical findings indicate that LOUD enhances the discoverability and integration of data in CH, requiring community-driven consensus on model interoperability. However, significant challenges include engaging marginalized groups, sustaining long-term participation, and balancing technological and social factors. Strategic use of technology and the capture of digital materiality are critical, but LOUD also poses challenges related to resource investment, data consistency, and the broader implementation of complex patterns.
LOUD should lead efforts to improve the accessibility and usability of CH data. The community-driven methodologies of IIIF and Linked Art inherently foster collaboration and transparency, making these standards essential tools in evolving data management practices.

<h2 id="cha:intro" tabindex="-1">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Since its inception in 2011, the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> has revolutionised<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> the accessibility
of image-based resources. Initially driven by the needs of manuscript
scholars, <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr>
focused on two-dimensional images, but has since expanded to encompass a
wide range of image-based resources, including audiovisual materials
and, in the near future, <abbr title="three-dimensional">3D</abbr> images. Similarly, Linked Art, formally
established in 2017, initially concentrated on art museum objects but
has since broadened its scope to model a variety of
<abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> entities,
leveraging <abbr title="CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model">CIDOC-CRM</abbr>, a renowned ontology in the museum and
<abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> space. Both
initiatives aim to break down silos: <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> focuses on improving the presentation of
digital objects, while both initiatives enhance their dissemination.
Together, they make <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data more accessible through
<abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and more
meaningful through Linked Art for machines. These efforts have primarily
benefited the <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>
domain.</p>
<p>A key commonality is that the main <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s these communities create align with the
<abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> design
principles, either intentionally or empirically demonstrated through use
cases. These principles enable software developers to develop compliant
tools and services without needing to fully understand
<abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr>, a syntax for
representing information on the web. Additionally, they may not need to
grasp all <abbr title="Linked Open Data">LOD</abbr>
principles, which promote the interlinking of data from diverse datasets
using tools like <abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr>
such as thesauri. <abbr title="Web Annotation Data Model">WADM</abbr>, a <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> standard, is also recognised as a
<abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> specification.
It provides a framework for creating interoperable annotations on web
resources, facilitating the linking and sharing of data across different
platforms and applications. These <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> design principles include the right
abstraction for the audience, few barriers to entry, comprehensibility
by introspection, documentation with working examples, and the use of
many consistent patterns rather than few exceptions. Additionally, both
<abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked
Art are driven by vibrant communities, mainly comprising
<abbr title="Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums">GLAM</abbr> and higher
education institutions.</p>
<p>While the standards and principles discussed have broad applications, it
is important to clarify the scope of this dissertation. This work does
not focus on <abbr title="Knowledge Graph">KG</abbr>s by
assessing triplestores – databases specifically designed to store and
retrieve triples, which are the fundamental data structures in
<abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr>. Similarly, it
does not deal with evaluating SPARQL engines, which are specifically designed
to query <abbr title="Knowledge Graph">KG</abbr>s.
Additionally, this dissertation does not address the intersection of
<abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> and
<abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr>, or the
ontological reasoning of Linked Art.</p>
<p>Instead, this dissertation concentrates on <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr>, the consistency of its standards, design
principles and the vibrant communities behind it. It examines
<abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data">JSON-LD</abbr>
serialisation efforts and the crucial intersection required to establish
robust semantic interoperability baselines between presentation and
semantic layers. It also presents real-world use case implementations,
both on a small scale in a laboratory and flexible space within the
<abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr> research
project, and on a large scale at Yale, exemplified by the LUX platform
that provides access to (meta)data from <abbr title="Yale University Library">YUL</abbr>, <abbr title="Yale Center for British Art">YCBA</abbr>, <abbr title="Yale University Art Gallery">YUAG</abbr>, and <abbr title="Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History">YPM</abbr>.</p>
<p>The focus is therefore on digital infrastructures capable of delivering
<abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data">JSON-LD</abbr> files
from the above specifications, which are primarily, though not
exclusively, <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>
resources. It is more about the different actors – both human and
non-human – that create and maintain these interconnected systems and
the dynamic interactions that sustain them. The deployment of various
<abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr>
specifications addresses the need for semantic interoperability between
<abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> resources and
disparate datasets by establishing a standardised approach to
representing and linking data, ensuring that information can be
seamlessly shared and understood across different platforms and
contexts.</p>
<p>This dissertation seeks to carve out a distinct niche by addressing an
often-overlooked aspect of <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art.
<abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> is sometimes
perceived and studied merely as a service or an appendix, with the
content it delivers taking precedence. However, this PhD thesis
positions <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> as
a first-class citizen worthy of in-depth study. Similarly, Linked Art,
despite its potential and its relatively recent establishment, has been
the subject of very few scholarly papers. This gap underscores the
significance of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> in this context. Furthermore, this thesis
elevates Linked Art to a position of primary importance, recognising its
significance and advocating for its thorough examination. To thoroughly
study <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> and its
adherence to design principles, it is essential to immerse ourselves
actively in both communities – an approach I have embraced for years.
The thesis also emphasises the importance of participatory efforts and
collaboration between research projects, which typically have shorter
lifespans, and memory institutions, which need to implement technical
standards as a <em>lingua franca</em>. In doing so, it reveals the mediating
role of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> in
advancing the heritage sphere. To truly understand
<abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr>, Linked Art,
and to a lesser extent <abbr title="Web Annotation Data Model">WADM</abbr>, it is crucial to examine the social
fabrics and consensus decision-making of each community. Among these
considerations are how the specifications can be implemented
pragmatically, and how the standards can support the implementation and
maintenance of more extensive semantic interoperability efforts.</p>
<p>The significance of this research lies in highlighting the commitment
and diligence of the individuals and organisations that make up both the
<abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked
Art communities. It aims to demonstrate that community-driven practices,
such as those exemplified by <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art, have a potential that
goes beyond the mere sharing of digital objects and their associated
metadata. The more people who embrace these approaches and implement the
associated specifications, the more society as a whole will benefit.
Furthermore, this research illustrates that <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> is no longer limited to two-dimensional
images, that Linked Art is not restricted to artworks, and that
<abbr title="Web Annotation Data Model">WADM</abbr> is a simple,
content-agnostic standard that can be easily integrated into a range of
systems. This adaptability is a strength of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> standards, which are designed to be
simple yet effective. <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> can serve a variety of purposes,
primarily rooted in <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>, but with the potential to extend its
benefits to other sectors. The true beauty of
<abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> lies in its
ability to foster networking opportunities and transparent
socio-technical practices, demonstrating its value beyond mere technical
implementation.</p>
<p>By emphasising these aspects, this dissertation highlights the wider
impact of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> in
promoting semantic interoperability and enhancing collaborative efforts
within the heritage field and beyond. In addition, the implementation of
standards through <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr> underlines the potential for similar
participatory or citizen science projects, while the LUX initiative
serves as an illustrative example of robust infrastructure and
cross-unit engagement. These examples demonstrate the practical
applications and far-reaching implications of adopting
<abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> standards in
different contexts.</p>
<p>This dissertation is structured across ten chapters, each building upon
the previous ones up to Chapter 5 to provide a comprehensive
understanding of the research. These initial chapters lay the foundation
of the study, establishing the context, theoretical framework, and
methodological approaches. After this foundational section, Chapters 6,
7, and 8 present empirical studies that, while interconnected, can be
read independently if desired. These chapters offer detailed insights
into specific aspects of the research and can be appreciated on their
own or as part of the broader narrative.</p>
<p>The thesis continues with <a href="#cha:context">Chapter 2</a>, which extends this introduction by providing
more information about the research setting, specifically
<abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr>. <a href="#cha:literature">Chapter 3</a> follows with
an extensive literature review, offering a comprehensive overview of
methods to interlink <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data. Next, <a href="#cha:theoretical">Chapter 4</a> presents the theoretical
framework, conceptualised as a toolbox and firmly rooted in
<abbr title="Actor-Network Theory">ANT</abbr>, guiding the
analysis and discussion throughout the dissertation. Following this, <a href="#cha:scope">Chapter 5</a>
details the research scope and methodology, explaining the approaches
and methods employed in the study.</p>
<p>Moving on to the empirical work, <a href="#cha:social-fabrics">Chapter 6</a> sheds light on the social fabrics of
<abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked
Art, exploring the communities and practices that underpin these
initiatives.<a href="#cha:pia-laboratory">Chapter 7</a> then examines the implementation of
<abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> standards
within <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr>,
highlighting the practical aspects and challenges encountered. This is
followed by <a href="#cha:lux-consistency">Chapter 8</a>, which focuses on the LUX initiative at Yale, examining the
underlying governance and interdepartmental ownership of the Yale
Collections Discovery platform. The discussion of findings is presented
in <a href="#cha:discussion">Chapter 9</a>, where the results from the empirical chapters are synthesised and
analysed in relation to the theoretical framework. Finally, <a href="#cha:conclusion">Chapter 10</a> concludes
the thesis, summarising the key insights and contributions of the
research while outlining potential directions for future study.</p>

<p>This chapter brings to a close the journey undertaken since February
2021, aiming to clearly articulate the answers to the research
questions, discuss how the research aligns with the objectives,
elucidate the significance of the work, outline its shortcomings, and
suggest avenues for future research.</p>
<p>I had the privilege of hearing the above poem at EuropeanaTech in The
Hague in October 2023. What struck me most, and what I have tried to
convey in this thesis, was the powerful dialogue and collective spirit
striving to harness the potential of our (digital) heritage. With a
sense of conviction after this conference, I approached the next one in
Geneva in February 2024 with confidence, believing that I had made a
compelling case for the concept of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr>. When a participant asked how
<abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> differed from
Linked Data, however, I found myself explaining the socio-technical
ethos of <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and
Linked Art, the richness of the individuals who make them up, the
ability to combine these different standards, and the common use cases
that emerge from these collaborations. Whether my answer was convincing
remains uncertain, but I knew it was too brief. Perhaps it is here, in
this conclusion, that my thoughts can find their full expression.</p>
<p>I believe that <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> should be at the forefront of efforts to
improve the accessibility and usability of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data, an endeavour that is increasingly
relevant in a web-centric environment. This paradigm has gained
considerable traction, particularly with the advent of Linked Art and
the recognition that the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> Presentation <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> has been an inspiration for the
<abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> design
principles. The development and maintenance of
<abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> standards by
dedicated communities are characterised by collaboration, consensus
building, and transparency. In the interstices of the
<abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked
Art communities, frameworks for interoperability are not only exposed,
but revealed as profound testaments to the power of transparent
collaboration across institutional boundaries. Both communities, it is
true, are still very much Anglo-Saxon efforts, where the specifications
have mainly been implemented in <abbr title="Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums">GLAM</abbr> and/or <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> research projects, or at least when we
have been aware of them. It has clear guidelines on how to propose use
cases, mostly using GitHub, and hides the sometimes unnecessary
<abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr> complexity
behind a set of <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data">JSON-LD</abbr> <code>@ context</code>. <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> is at the presentation layer and can
really play its role as a mediator, with the Manifest as its central
unit connecting other specifications, including semantic metadata, and
preferably with simpatico specifications such as Linked Art.</p>
<p>An important hypothesis arises from the observation that adherence to
the <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> design
principles makes specifications more likely to be adopted. The primary
benefit of adopting <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> standards lies in their grassroots
nature. This grassroots approach not only aligns with the core values of
openness and collaboration within the <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> community but also serves as a common
denominator between <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> practitioners and
<abbr title="Cultural Heritage Institution">CHI</abbr>s. This unique
alignment fosters a sense of shared purpose and common ground. However,
it’s essential to acknowledge that while <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> and its associated standards, including
IIIF, hold immense promise, their limited recognition in the wider
socio-technical ecosystem may currently hinder their full potential
impact beyond the <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>
domain.</p>
<p>Consideration of socio-technical requirements and the promotion of
digital equity are essential to the development of specifications in
line with the <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr>
design principles. In the context of the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art communities, this means
both recognising current challenges and building on existing practices.
This includes forming alliances that support diverse forms of inclusion
at both project and individual levels. For example, organisations should
be encouraged to send representatives from diverse professional and
personal backgrounds, such as underrepresented groups or non-technical
fields. This can be facilitated by initiatives that lower the barriers
to participation, such as financial support for travel and
participation, flexible participation formats, and targeted outreach
efforts. Furthermore, as these standards often align with open
government data initiatives, they present opportunities for broader
public engagement and institutional transparency.</p>
<p>In the broader context of <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr>, understanding
<abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> involves
tracing the historical development of the field and its evolving
relationship with technology. The interdisciplinary nature of
<abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> has always
integrated diverse scholarly and technical practices. In recent years,
<abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> has seen a
notable increase in interest in the use of Linked Data and semantic
technologies to improve the discoverability and accessibility of
<abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> collections.
<abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr>'s emphasis on
user-centred design and usability aligns well with these goals.
Consequently, the principles of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> hold great promise for advancing the
integration and use of community-driven <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s and/or Linked Data within
<abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr>. This can be seen
within <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr>, where
the benefits of implementing <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> helped us to streamline machine-generated
annotations, integrate different thumbnails into
<abbr title="Graphical user interface">GUI</abbr> prototypes,
model photo albums with different layers from the Kreis Family
collection, and enable project members and students to engage in digital
storytelling, an important participatory facet that can be seamlessly
explored by <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr>
efforts and <abbr title="Cultural Heritage Institution">CHI</abbr>s with
the help of the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> Image and Presentation
<abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s. Data reuse is
definitely a key <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> driver, which could have been done more
extensively with a productive instance of Linked Art. As for widening
participation, this is definitely a strategic and political decision,
rather than a technical one. That said, <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> specifications can definitely be embedded
through strategic citizen science initiatives.</p>
<p>A recent example that highlights the comprehensive value of Linked Data
was presented by (Newbury, 2024) at the <abbr title="Coalition for Networked Information">CNI</abbr> Spring 2024 Meeting. He delineated its
significance as extending well beyond single entities, such as the Getty
Research Institute, to enrich a vast ecosystem. Specifically, he
identified three principal areas of value: Firstly, within the ecosystem
itself, where the utility of information is amplified through its
application in diverse contexts. Secondly, for the audience, by directly
addressing user needs and facilitating various conceptual frameworks.
And finally, within the community, by enabling wider use and adaptation
of data and code. This approach to Linked Data, as articulated by
Newbury, not only enhances its utility across these dimensions, but also
aligns seamlessly with the <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> proposition, underscoring a shared vision
for a digital space where the interconnectedness and accessibility of
(meta)data serve as foundational principles for progress and community
engagement.</p>
<p>LUX, as a catalyst for <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr>, exemplifies a practical approach to
implementing Linked Data that has garnered significant local engagement
and support at Yale. This initiative demonstrates how sound
socio-technical practices can be effectively applied within a supportive
institutional environment. The consistency of the data within LUX aligns
well with <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and
Linked Art standards, with only a few minor adjustments required for
full compliance. These quick fixes are manageable and do not detract
from the overall robustness of the initiative. While it may be too early
to fully assess the wider impact of using <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> specifications on the LUX platform within
the <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> domain, the
initiative has already attracted considerable interest in recent months.
This growing attention suggests that the LUX approach is resonating with
other organisations, suggesting the potential for wider adoption and
impact. The enthusiastic local engagement at Yale provides a strong
foundation for LUX and highlights its potential to serve as a model for
similar projects aimed at enriching digital heritage through effective
collaboration and agreed-upon standards.</p>
<p>In carrying out this thesis, I have adhered to the five main objectives
set out at the beginning of the PhD. These objectives have been
accomplished to a high degree, reflecting a substantial and
well-executed project. Furthermore, most of the outputs – such as data
models and scripts – from this work are available on GitHub, providing
open access to the wider community. In addition, I have published
several papers, both individually and collaboratively, further
disseminating the findings and contributions of this research.</p>
<p>Additionally, this thesis is relevant because it sheds light on
communities and implementations that can be celebrated not only for
their standards but also for their operating ethos;
<abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked
Art present models ripe for emulation beyond their immediate digital
confines. Here, agency and authority are most typically granted to the
collective over the isolated, with each actor - be it an individual, an
institution or an interface – intricately interconnected. Yale’s LUX
initiative also embodies this ethos, demonstrating how collaborative
efforts can lead to innovative solutions and wider impact. It is to be
hoped, then, that these practices of openness and multiple partnerships
will not be seen as limited to their origins in digital representation.
At the very least, I hope that these socio-technical approaches can
serve as exemplars or sources of inspiration in broader arenas, where
the principles of mutual visibility and concerted action can point the
way towards cohesive and adaptive collaborative architectures.</p>
<p>Despite its contribution, this thesis is far from perfect and certainly
contains several shortcomings. I will name here three significant ones.
First, the visualisations included and the use of
<abbr title="First-order logic">FOL</abbr> are primarily
designed to support my own self-reflection and may be more beneficial to
me than to the broader academic community. While they provide insights
into my research process and findings, their applicability and
usefulness to others might be limited. Second, the theoretical framework
I employed, while instrumental to my research, may not serve as a
universally applicable toolbox. Nevertheless, I urge readers to pay
close attention to <abbr title="Science and Technology Studies">STS</abbr> methodologies and practices. The works of
Bruno Latour, Donna Haraway, and Susan Leigh Star have been invaluable
companions throughout this dissertation. Additionally, for those
involved in conceptualising semantic information, I recommend exploring
Floridi’s <abbr title="Philosophy of Information">PI</abbr>, which
offers profound insights into the nature and dynamics of information.
These readings have greatly influenced my approach and understanding,
and I believe they can offer valuable perspectives to others as well.
Third, while the thesis aims to address both community practices and
semantic interoperability, it leans more heavily towards the former.
This emphasis on community practices may overshadow the broader
discussion of semantic interoperability, potentially limiting the appeal
of the thesis to those primarily interested in the technical aspects.</p>
<p>Other shortcomings include the broad scope of the thesis, with three
empirical chapters exploring different avenues. While this comprehensive
approach provides a broad understanding of the research topic, it has
also resulted in a rather lengthy thesis. This may be a challenge for
the reader, as a topic of interest in one chapter may not be as
compelling in another. The diversity of empirical focus, while enriching
the research, may dilute the coherence for some readers, making it more
difficult to maintain a consistent engagement throughout the
dissertation. Despite these limitations, I hope that the different
perspectives and findings contribute to a richer, more nuanced
understanding of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> for <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>.</p>
<p>Avenues for future research are numerous and promising. One interesting
area to explore is the comparative benefits experienced by early
adopters of <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr>
and Linked Art specifications versus those who implemented these
standards later. Early adopters have the advantage of having their use
cases discussed and resolved within the community, and it would be
insightful to analyse the long-term impacts on their projects. Such a
study is already feasible for early adopters of
<abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and will
become possible to compare further implementations of Linked Art within
a few years. Furthermore, future exploration could focus on the full
implementation of Linked Art within <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr> or similar efforts, as well as more
performance-oriented testing with the deployed
<abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr>
<abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s. These efforts
should further validate the robustness and scalability of these
specifications. Another important area for future investigation is the
participation of institutions and individuals from the Global South in
both the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and
Linked Art communities. It is crucial to explore how we can better
support their uptake of these specifications and encourage their active
involvement in these initiatives to ensure a more inclusive and globally
representative environment.</p>
<p>As I reflect on the journey of this thesis, I am reminded of the
powerful dialogue and collective effort that has been at its heart. Mr
Gee’s poem resonates deeply with my own aspirations for this work: to
enhance our understanding of the past through openness and
collaboration, as can be seen in <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art. As I bring this
dissertation to a close, I am filled with a sense of accomplishment and
a renewed commitment to promoting sound socio-technical practices. It is
my hope that the insights and methodologies presented here will inspire
others to engage in this ongoing dialogue, continually asking and
answering the many questions that arise as we collectively explore our
cultural heritage landscapes.</p>
