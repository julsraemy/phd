    <meta name="description" content="Digital technologies have fundamentally transformed how Cultural Heritage (CH) collections are accessed and engaged with. Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) specifications, including the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) Presentation API 3.0, Linked Art, and the Web Annotation Data Model (WADM), have emerged as web standards to facilitate the description and dissemination of these valuable resources. Despite the widespread adoption of IIIF, implementing LOUD specifications, particularly in combination, remains challenging. This is especially evident in the development and assessment of infrastructures, or sites of assemblage, that support these standards.
This research is guided by two perspectives: community practices and semantic interoperability. The first perspective assesses how organizations, individuals, and apparatuses engage with and contribute to the consensus-making processes surrounding LOUD. By examining these practices, the social fabrics of the LOUD ecosystem can be better understood. The second perspective focuses on making data meaningful to machines in a standardized, interoperable manner that promotes the exchange of well-formed information. This research is grounded in the SNSF-funded project, *Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives* (PIA) (2021–2025), which aims to develop a citizen science platform for three photographic collections from the Cultural Anthropology Switzerland (CAS) archives. Actor-Network Theory (ANT) forms the theoretical foundation, aiming to describe the collaborative structures of the LOUD ecosystem and emphasize the role of non-human actors.
Beyond its implementation within the PIA project, this research includes an analysis of the social dynamics within the IIIF and Linked Art communities and an investigation of Yale's Collections Discovery platform, LUX. The research identifies socio-technical requirements for developing specifications aligned with LOUD principles. It also examines how the implementation of LOUD standards in PIA highlights their potential benefits and limitations in facilitating data reuse and broader participation. Additionally, it explores Yale University's large-scale deployment of LOUD standards, emphasizing the importance of ensuring consistency between Linked Art and IIIF resources within the LUX platform for the CH domain.
The core methodology of this thesis is an actor- and practice-centered inquiry, focusing on a detailed examination of specific cosmologies within LOUD-driven communities, PIA, and LUX. This micro-perspective approach provides rich empirical evidence to unravel the intricate web of cultural processes and constellations in these contexts.
Key empirical findings indicate that LOUD enhances the discoverability and integration of data in CH, requiring community-driven consensus on model interoperability. However, significant challenges include engaging marginalized groups, sustaining long-term participation, and balancing technological and social factors. Strategic use of technology and the capture of digital materiality are critical, but LOUD also poses challenges related to resource investment, data consistency, and the broader implementation of complex patterns.
LOUD should lead efforts to improve the accessibility and usability of CH data. The community-driven methodologies of IIIF and Linked Art inherently foster collaboration and transparency, making these standards essential tools in evolving data management practices. Even for institutions and projects that do not adopt these specifications, the socio-technical practices of LOUD offer vital insights into effective digital stewardship and strategies for community engagement.">

<h2 id="cha:intro" tabindex="-1">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Since its inception in 2011, the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> has revolutionised<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> the accessibility of image-based resources. Initially driven by the needs of manuscript scholars, <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> focused on two-dimensional images, but has since expanded to encompass a wide range of image-based resources, including audiovisual materials and, in the near future, <abbr title="three-dimensional">3D</abbr> images. Similarly, Linked Art, formally established in 2017, initially concentrated on art museum objects but has since broadened its scope to model a variety of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> entities, leveraging <abbr title="CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model">CIDOC-CRM</abbr>, a renowned ontology in the museum and <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> space. Both initiatives aim to break down silos: <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> focuses on improving the presentation of digital objects, while both initiatives enhance their dissemination. Together, they make <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data more accessible through <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and more meaningful through Linked Art for machines. These efforts have primarily benefited the <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> domain.</p>
<p>A key commonality is that the main <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s these communities create align with the <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> design principles, either intentionally or empirically demonstrated through use cases. These principles enable software developers to develop compliant tools and services without needing to fully understand <abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr>, a syntax for representing information on the web. Additionally, they may not need to grasp all <abbr title="Linked Open Data">LOD</abbr> principles, which promote the interlinking of data from diverse datasets using tools like <abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr> such as thesauri. <abbr title="Web Annotation Data Model">WADM</abbr>, a <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> standard, is also recognised as a <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> specification. It provides a framework for creating interoperable annotations on web resources, facilitating the linking and sharing of data across different platforms and applications. These <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> design principles include the right abstraction for the audience, few barriers to entry, comprehensibility by introspection, documentation with working examples, and the use of many consistent patterns rather than few exceptions. Additionally, both <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art are driven by vibrant communities, mainly comprising <abbr title="Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums">GLAM</abbr> and higher education institutions.</p>
<p>While the standards and principles discussed have broad applications, it is important to clarify the scope of this dissertation. This work does not focus on <abbr title="Knowledge Graph">KG</abbr>s by assessing triplestores – databases specifically designed to store and retrieve triples, which are the fundamental data structures in <abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr>. Similarly, it does not deal with evaluating SPARQL engines, which are specifically designed to query <abbr title="Knowledge Graph">KG</abbr>s. Additionally, this dissertation does not address the intersection of <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> and <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr>, or the ontological reasoning of Linked Art.</p>
<p>Instead, this dissertation concentrates on <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr>, the consistency of its standards, design principles and the vibrant communities behind it. It examines <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data">JSON-LD</abbr> serialisation efforts and the crucial intersection required to establish robust semantic interoperability baselines between presentation and semantic layers. It also presents real-world use case implementations, both on a small scale in a laboratory and flexible space within the <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr> research project, and on a large scale at Yale, exemplified by the LUX platform that provides access to (meta)data from <abbr title="Yale University Library">YUL</abbr>, <abbr title="Yale Center for British Art">YCBA</abbr>, <abbr title="Yale University Art Gallery">YUAG</abbr>, and <abbr title="Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History">YPM</abbr>.</p>
<p>The focus is therefore on digital infrastructures capable of delivering <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data">JSON-LD</abbr> files from the above specifications, which are primarily, though not exclusively, <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> resources. It is more about the different actors – both human and non-human – that create and maintain these interconnected systems and the dynamic interactions that sustain them. The deployment of various <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> specifications addresses the need for semantic interoperability between <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> resources and disparate datasets by establishing a standardised approach to representing and linking data, ensuring that information can be seamlessly shared and understood across different platforms and contexts.</p>
<p>This dissertation seeks to carve out a distinct niche by addressing an often-overlooked aspect of <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art. <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> is sometimes perceived and studied merely as a service or an appendix, with the content it delivers taking precedence. However, this PhD thesis positions <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> as a first-class citizen worthy of in-depth study. Similarly, Linked Art, despite its potential and its relatively recent establishment, has been the subject of very few scholarly papers. This gap underscores the significance of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> in this context. Furthermore, this thesis elevates Linked Art to a position of primary importance, recognising its significance and advocating for its thorough examination. To thoroughly study <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> and its adherence to design principles, it is essential to immerse ourselves actively in both communities – an approach I have embraced for years. The thesis also emphasises the importance of participatory efforts and collaboration between research projects, which typically have shorter lifespans, and memory institutions, which need to implement technical standards as a <em>lingua franca</em>. In doing so, it reveals the mediating role of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> in advancing the heritage sphere. To truly understand <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr>, Linked Art, and to a lesser extent <abbr title="Web Annotation Data Model">WADM</abbr>, it is crucial to examine the social fabrics and consensus decision-making of each community. Among these considerations are how the specifications can be implemented pragmatically, and how the standards can support the implementation and maintenance of more extensive semantic interoperability efforts.</p>
<p>The significance of this research lies in highlighting the commitment and diligence of the individuals and organisations that make up both the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art communities. It aims to demonstrate that community-driven practices, such as those exemplified by <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art, have a potential that goes beyond the mere sharing of digital objects and their associated metadata. The more people who embrace these approaches and implement the associated specifications, the more society as a whole will benefit. Furthermore, this research illustrates that <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> is no longer limited to two-dimensional images, that Linked Art is not restricted to artworks, and that <abbr title="Web Annotation Data Model">WADM</abbr> is a simple, content-agnostic standard that can be easily integrated into a range of systems. This adaptability is a strength of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> standards, which are designed to be simple yet effective. <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> can serve a variety of purposes, primarily rooted in <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>, but with the potential to extend its benefits to other sectors. The true beauty of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> lies in its ability to foster networking opportunities and transparent socio-technical practices, demonstrating its value beyond mere technical implementation.</p>
<p>By emphasising these aspects, this dissertation highlights the wider impact of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> in promoting semantic interoperability and enhancing collaborative efforts within the heritage field and beyond. In addition, the implementation of standards through <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr> underlines the potential for similar participatory or citizen science projects, while the LUX initiative serves as an illustrative example of robust infrastructure and cross-unit engagement. These examples demonstrate the practical applications and far-reaching implications of adopting <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> standards in different contexts.</p>
<p>This dissertation is structured across ten chapters, each building upon the previous ones up to Chapter 5 to provide a comprehensive understanding of the research. These initial chapters lay the foundation of the study, establishing the context, theoretical framework, and methodological approaches. After this foundational section, Chapters 6, 7, and 8 present empirical studies that, while interconnected, can be read independently if desired. These chapters offer detailed insights into specific aspects of the research and can be appreciated on their own or as part of the broader narrative.</p>

Following this, <a href="#cha:scope">Chapter 5</a> details the research scope and methodology, explaining the approaches and methods employed in the study.</p>
<p>Moving on to the empirical work, <a href="#cha:social-fabrics">Chapter 6</a> sheds light on the social fabrics of <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art, exploring the communities and practices that underpin these initiatives.<a href="#cha:pia-laboratory">Chapter 7</a> then examines the implementation of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> standards
within <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr>, highlighting the practical aspects and challenges encountered. This is followed by <a href="#cha:lux-consistency">Chapter 8</a>, which focuses on the LUX initiative at Yale, examining the underlying governance and interdepartmental ownership of the Yale Collections Discovery platform. The discussion of findings is presented in <a href="#cha:discussion">Chapter 9</a>, where the results from the empirical chapters are synthesised and analysed in relation to the theoretical framework.

the thesis, summarising the key insights and contributions of the
research while outlining potential directions for future study.</p>
<h2 id="cha:context" tabindex="-1">2. Context</h2>
<p>In this chapter, I will set the stage for my PhD thesis by providing important background information. First, in <a href="#sec:title">Section 2.1</a>, I will explain why I chose the title for my thesis. This will give you an understanding of the main focus and the direction of my research. Next, in , I will describe the <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr> research project, which is central to my work. This section will cover the project’s goals, significance, and overall framework. In , I will detail my specific contributions to the <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr> project. I will emphasise how my work fits into the larger project and its importance to my thesis. Finally, in , I will talk about my active participation in the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art communities. This section will highlight how my involvement in these communities has influenced my research and its broader implications.</p>
<h3 id="sec:title" tabindex="-1">2.1 PhD Title</h3>
<p>I chose the title ‘Linked Open Usable Data for Cultural Heritage: Perspectives on
Community Practices and Semantic Interoperability’ as it encapsulates the essence of my research focus but I could have indeed chosen other ones.</p>
<p>During the initial stages of my research, multiple working titles were explored to capture the diverse facets of my interests and objectives. If I was quite sure about having in the title after the third iteration, I was quite unsure of what should follow and if a subtitle was actually needed at all. Amidst this dynamic progression, the underlying theme of my research remained steadfast – to delve into the transformative potential of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> for <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>.</p>
<p>I also opted to maintain in the title of my thesis subsection. While holds its appeal, my choice reflects a broader narrative that acknowledges the crucial role of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage Institution">CHI</abbr>s and spotlighting the multifaceted nature of heritage preservation, encapsulating both its digital facets and the essential contribution of individuals and institutions in curating, interpreting, and making heritage accessible.</p>
<p>As for the subtitle, while I do explore <abbr title="Communites of Practice">CoP</abbr> as defined by (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991) and (Wenger, 2011) through investigating the social fabrics of the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art communities, my main interest lies in the broader application of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> for describing and interlinking <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> resources. Thus, I decided to opt for the more generic as the first axis or perspective.</p>
<p>For the second perspective, I wanted to see how semantic interoperability can be achieved through standards adhering to the <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> design principles, as they seem to be key enablers for seamless collaboration and knowledge exchange among practitioners. There was a time in my research when I envisaged decoupling and , perceiving them as two distinct dimensions. However, what really captivates me is the unification of these factors to facilitate collective reasoning for both humans and machines.</p>
<p>In summary, this title reflects my enthusiasm for using web-based and community-driven technologies to transform the way we understand, share and value <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>.</p>
<h3 id="sec:pia" tabindex="-1">2.2 The PIA Research Project</h3>
<p>I undertook my doctoral studies within the scope of the <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr> research project financed by the <abbr title="Swiss National Science Foundation">SNSF</abbr> under their Sinergia funding scheme from February 2021 to January 2025<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>. The project aimed to analyse the interplay of participants, epistemological orders and the graphical representation of information and knowledge in relation to three photographic collections from <abbr title="Cultural Anthropology Switzerland">CAS</abbr>. It sought to bring together the world of data and things in an interdisciplinary manner, exploring the phases of the analogue and digital archive from a cultural anthropological, technical and design research perspective (Felsing et al., 2023, p. 42). As part of this endeavour, interfaces were developed to enable the collaborative indexing and use of photographic archival records (Chiquet et al., 2023, p. 110). I discuss in more detail the interdisciplinary components and briefly introduce the people involved in the project in , then talk about the photographic collections that were the overarching narrative of the research in , and lastly in , the vision that we had put together.</p>

<p>Data processing offers great potential for humanities research as Owens [2011] argues: ‘In the end,
the kinds of questions humanists ask about texts and artifacts are just as relevant to ask of data. While
the new and exciting prospects of processing data offer humanists a range of exciting possibilities for
research, humanistic approaches to the textual and artifactual qualities of data also have a considerable
amount to offer to the interpretation of data’.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This chapter presents a comprehensive discussion where I interpret, analyse and critically examine my findings in relation to the thesis and the wider application of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr>. Through an in-depth analysis of the design principles of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> and their implications for <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>, this discussion aims to demonstrate the many challenges and opportunities inherent in this framework. The focus is on achieving community-driven consensus, rather than simply pursuing technological breakthrough.</p>
<p>The following sections are organised to provide a comprehensive review of the empirical findings, an evaluation abstracting <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr>, and a retrospective analysis of the research journey. Firstly, in <a href="#sec:empirical-findings">Section 9.1</a>, I will present a summary of the empirical findings from my research. This will include key themes and insights, structured to reflect the different areas of study and practice within <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr>.</p>
<p>Secondly, in <a href="#sec:evaluation-loud">Section 9.2</a> I will provide an evaluation of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> by means of using the <abbr title="Levels of Abstraction">LoA</abbr> approach. This evaluation will focus on the impact of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> on the perception of Linked Data within the <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> domain and the wider <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> field. This will include the key themes and insights that have emerged, structured in a way that reflects four levels of abstraction. I will also explore the dual nature of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> implementation, involving both simplicity and complexity, and discuss the various factors that influence such dynamics.</p>
<p>Finally, in <a href="#sec:retrospective-ant">Section 9.3</a>, I will offer a retrospective analysis of the research journey. This section will interpret the findings to situate <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> as fully-fledged actors. It will reflect on the challenges, achievements, and lessons learned throughout the research process, providing a holistic view of the project’s trajectory and its implications for the future of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr>.</p>
<h3 id="sec:empirical-findings" tabindex="-1">9.1 Empirical Findings</h3>
<p>This section summarises the empirical findings of my research and already offers some suggestions. The structure does not follow the exact order of the three empirical chapters but is organised around overarching topics that emerged throughout the study. The seven topics include Community Practices and Standards, Inclusion and Marginalised Groups, Maintenance and Community Engagement, Interoperability and Usability, Future Directions and Sustainability, Digital Materiality and Representation, as well as Challenges of Scaling and Implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Community Practices and Standards</strong></p>
<p><em>GitHub serves as a vital hub for community involvement, with a core group of active contributors often attending meetings regularly. This platform simplifies decision-making within the community, although it also reflects biases similar to those in <abbr title="Free/Libre and Open Source Software">FLOSS</abbr> communities. Behind visible activities like meetings, there is     substantial preparatory work managed by co-chairs, editorial boards, or driven by community-generated use cases. This foundational work often determines the direction and outcomes of formal gatherings. The LUX project at Yale, as seen in , has successfully fostered collaboration across various units, bringing together libraries and museums on a unified platform. The technological foundation of LUX, based on open standards, facilitates data integration and cross-collections discovery.</em></p>
<p><em>Not only does the deployment of <abbr title="Free/Libre and Open Source Software">FLOSS</abbr> tools contribute to these     achievements, but it also emphasises the social advantages of working collaboratively. The concept of the Tragedy of the Commons,     as described by (Hardin, 1968), highlights the potential for     individual self-interest to deplete shared resources. However, (Ostrom, 1990) offers a counterpoint by demonstrating how     communities can successfully manage common resources through     collective action and shared norms. In this context, initiatives like the <abbr title="Community Health Analytics in Open Source Software">CHAOSS</abbr> initiative<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> play a significant role by providing metrics that help evaluate the health and     sustainability of open source communities. These metrics include     contributions, issue resolution times, and community growth,     offering valuable insights into how collaborative efforts can be     maintained and improved.</em></p>
<p><em>Reaching consensus is another critical aspect of community practices     and standards. While the minutes of meetings are valuable artefacts,     they often reflect an Anglo-Saxon approach to decision-making     characterised by few substantive points and critical turning points.     The formal aspects of conversations captured in minutes do not fully     encompass the decision-making process, which frequently involves     informal conversations, consensus-building through open dialogue,     and subtle cues that influence outcomes. These elements are integral     to the English and American approach and hold valuable lessons for     an international community. <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art are international     communities, but decisions are made in English and the majority of     participants are based in North America and the UK, significantly     imprinting this approach. Understanding these nuances can help us     improve our collaborative efforts within the     <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and     Linked Art communities. By recognising and appreciating these     different facets of decision-making, we can learn from each other     and enhance our collective ability to make effective and inclusive     decisions.</em></p>
<p><em>Some of the challenges associated with these practices include the     major demand on resources for community building, the slowness     inherent in distributed development, and the difficulty in achieving     consensus. Additionally, the concept of social sustainability can be     seen as an imaginary construct that papers over differences, as     discussed by  Addressing these challenges     is crucial for the long-term success and effectiveness of the     <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and     Linked Art communities.</em></p>
<p><strong>Inclusion and Marginalised Groups</strong></p>
<p><em>The demographic homogeneity in these communities can perpetuate     biases and neglect issues relevant to underrepresented or     marginalised groups, as seen in . Participation in these     standardisation processes is itself a privilege. The assumption that     internet access and digital devices are universally available is     critically examined, revealing key actors in the digital landscape.     This mirrors issues within the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> community, where generating     <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> resources     presupposes means that may not be accessible to all.</em></p>
<p><em>We need clear terms of inclusion, as highlighted by      She argues that effective inclusion requires a     critical examination of the frameworks and conditions under which     inclusion is offered. The framework should ensure that inclusion     initiatives do not merely add diversity to existing power structures     but work to transform these structures fundamentally. This involves     questioning who defines the terms of inclusion, who benefits from     them, and who may be inadvertently excluded. (Hoffmann, 2021)     suggests a participatory approach, where marginalised communities     are actively involved in shaping inclusion policies and practices,     thus making inclusion an ongoing, reflective process rather than a     static goal.</em></p>
<p><em>The inclusion of marginalised groups is a necessary step, but it is     not sufficient. To truly make a difference, there must be a     strategic and concentrated effort to appropriate technologies, as     emphasised by     (Morales, 2009, 2017, 2018) and further     articulated by     (Martinez Demarco, 2019, 2023). This strategic approach highlights     the political significance of challenging dominant neoliberal and     consumerist perspectives on technology and individual engagement.</em></p>
<p><em>(Martinez Demarco, 2023) underscores the critical importance     of focusing on practices that go beyond mere inclusion. Instead, it     requires a deep understanding and critical assessment of how     technology is intertwined with social, economic, and ideological     contexts. It implies a reflective and deliberate process of     technology adoption in which individuals creatively tailor     technology to their specific needs, beliefs, and interests.     Moreover, a key aspect highlighted by (Martinez Demarco, 2023)     is the implicit and explicit critique of a universalist approach to     inclusion, which often lends itself to all too easy     instrumentalisation. Understanding and studying resistance to     inclusion in an oppressive digital transformation context is     paramount, particularly given the highly unequal conditions that     prevail.</em></p>
<p><em>In this light, a comprehensive study of socio-material and symbolic     processes, practices, and involved in embedding technologies into     individuals’ lives is needed. This approach also recognises     technology as a catalyst for change. It envisions the use of     technology to drive meaningful change at multiple dimensions and     realities—national, societal, or personal. By focusing on these     practices, empowering individuals to navigate and use technology     thoughtfully and purposefully becomes a reality, bridging the gap     between technological advances and societal progress     (Martinez Demarco, 2019).</em></p>
<p><strong>Maintenance and Community Engagement</strong></p>
<p><em>The tension between creating advanced specifications and their     practical implementation by platforms is evident in the IIIF     Cookbook recipes and Linked Art patterns, as discussed in <a href="#cha:social-fabrics">Chapter 6</a>. This     ongoing development shows that the community is still finding the     best ways to achieve broad adoption and interoperability. The     deployment of the Change Discovery <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>, as illustrated in <a href="#cha:pia-laboratory">Chapter 7</a>, demonstrates     that establishing such a protocol on top of the     <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr>     Presentation <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> is feasible and straightforward.     High-level support from leadership, particularly Susan Gibbons as     Vice Provost, has been crucial in building trust and ensuring the     project’s success as a valuable discovery layer at Yale. This     integration of diverse collections through a unified platform, based     on open standards, highlights the potential for transforming     teaching, learning, and research by leveraging collaborative     efforts. The topic modelling exercise in LUX reveals the intricate     actor-networks composed of organisations, individuals, and non-human     actors. This analysis underscores the importance of ongoing     processes and relationships in maintaining and evolving     infrastructure, akin to the concept of ‘infrastructuring’.</em></p>
<p><em>As detailed in <a href="#cha:lux-consistency">Chapter 8</a>, following best practices and guidelines such as the     <abbr title="Sustainable, Harvestable, Available, Reconciled, Enriched, Diverse">SHARED</abbr>     Principles is essential for better involvement, but it is also     crucial to uphold these commitments consistently over the long term     to ensure meaningful participation. Between the     <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr> team     members, there were sometimes ‘disconnects between different communities who undertake collaborative research’ (Vienni-Baptista et al., 2023).     This was something we had to navigate and learn from, which was     manageable within the context of a laboratory setting. However, for     any follow-up projects or whatever forms the digital infrastructure     we built may take, it is imperative that these disconnects are     addressed and solidified to ensure cohesive and sustained community     engagement.</em></p>
<p><strong>Interoperability and Usability</strong></p>
<p><em>Within <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr>,     different <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s     have been progressively deployed to meet various requirements while     allowing parallel exploration of data modelling. Each     <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> offers     unique advantages, but their collective integration promotes     semantic interoperability. For example, the     <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> Image     <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> has been     instrumental in rationalising image distribution across prototypes,     providing efficient access to high-quality digital surrogates and     the ability to resize them for different uses. Adherence to     <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> standards     and schemas within LUX has generally been positive, although     transitioning between versions of a specification can present     challenges, highlighting the need to improve the consistency of     compliant resources.</em></p>
<p><em>Linked Art, for instance, has the capacity to generate various     insights and sources of truth around different entities. However,     additional or entirely new vocabularies from sources like the Getty     may need to be used – such as Homosaurus. Complementary to Linked     Art, using <abbr title="Web Annotation Data Model">WADM</abbr> allows for assertions that go beyond     purely descriptive narratives, though it may sacrifice some semantic     richness. This complexity in managing vocabularies and maintaining     semantic richness directly ties into broader usability     considerations within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>Addressing these usability concerns, Robert Sanderson has suggested     focusing on the use of full <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s in Linked Art to ensure computational     usability, in contrast to <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr>‘s approach of minimising     <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s to enhance     readability. This difference highlights a fundamental question in     usability: balancing readability and computational usability.     Understanding developers’ perspectives on these approaches is     critical.</em></p>
<p><em>I would suggest as a way forward for the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art communities to focus     on further improving usability of the specifications. This includes     conducting comprehensive usability assessments of     <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s to evaluate     the experiences of new developers versus existing ones,     understanding the steepness of the learning curve associated with     each <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>, and     guiding improvements in documentation, on-boarding processes, and     overall developer support. Efforts should be made to lower the     barriers to entry for new developers by developing more intuitive     and user-friendly tutorials, providing example projects, and     creating a robust support community. Ensuring that developers can     quickly and effectively leverage <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s will foster greater adoption.     Addressing the challenges of transitioning between different     versions of specifications is critical, and developing tools and     guidelines that help maintain consistency across versions will     reduce friction and ensure smoother updates.</em></p>
<p><strong>Future Directions and Sustainability</strong></p>
<p><em>Survey findings, as discussed in , underscore the need for ongoing     efforts to develop <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> standards that foster an inclusive,     dynamic digital ecosystem. Future strategies should include creating     educational resources and frameworks that support interdisciplinary     collaboration and reduce barriers to participation. While the     Manifest serves as the fundamental unit within     <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr>, the     Linked Art protocol can play a similar central role as semantic     gateways in broader contexts, allowing round-tripping across the     <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s. The topic     modelling exercise in LUX, detailed in , reveals complex     actor-networks of organisations, individuals, and non-human actors,     providing insights into the relationships sustaining the LUX     initiative.</em></p>
<p><em>The next steps for Linked Art might involve forming a new consortium     independent of a <abbr title="ICOM International Committee for Documentation">CIDOC</abbr> Working Group, which could provide     the necessary support to sustain the initiative. Alternatively,     integrating Linked Art into <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> as a new <abbr title="Technical Specification Group">TSG</abbr> and specification could address the     discovery challenges within <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr>, as discussed during the birds of a     feather session led by Robert Sanderson (see Raemy, 2024) at     the 2024 <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr>     Conference in Los Angeles<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>. Design principles that act as     bridges across different disciplines, as proposed by     (Roke &amp; Tillman, 2022), are crucial. <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> has demonstrated that this     collaborative approach is feasible, and Linked Art could follow in     its footsteps. However, achieving this requires increased dedication     from passive members and broader adoption of the model and the     <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> ecosystem     in the near future.</em></p>
<p><strong>Digital Materiality and Representation</strong></p>
<p><em>As explored in <a href="#cha:pia-laboratory">Chapter 7</a>, the detailed digital representation of photographic     albums, such as the Kreis Family Collection, demonstrates the need     to comprehensively capture the materiality of digital objects. This     includes the structure and context of images, which are crucial for     maintaining their historical and social significance. The     implementation of the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> Presentation     <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> in creating     a detailed digital replica of the Getty’s Bayard Album shows how     digital materiality can be enhanced through thoughtful use of     technology, but also highlights the scalability challenges for such     detailed representations.</em></p>
<p><em>Creating these detailed digital representations can be seen as a ‘boutique’     approach, which, while labour-intensive and resource-demanding, is     necessary for preserving the integrity and contextual significance     of cultural heritage objects. The challenge lies in developing the     appropriate means and methodologies to achieve this level of detail     consistently. Future endeavours, whether through research projects     or collaborative efforts between <abbr title="Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums">GLAM</abbr> institutions and     <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr>     practitioners, should aim to address these challenges and create     sustainable practices for digital materiality and representation. As     Edwards aptly notes:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Presentational forms equally reflect specific intent in the use and value of the photographs they embed, to the extent that the objects that embed photographs are in many cases meaningless without their photographs; for instance, empty frames or albums. These objects are only invigorated when they are again in conjunction with the images with which they have a symbiotic relationship, for display functions not only make the thing itself visible but make it more visible in certain ways‘.

<p><strong>Challenges of Scaling and Implementation</strong></p>
<p><em>As seen in <a href="#cha:social-fabrics">Chapter 6</a>, the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> Cookbook recipes and Linked Art     patterns reflect the tension between creating advanced     specifications and their practical implementation. This gap between     ideation and real-world application underscores the challenges faced     by the community in achieving broad adoption and interoperability.     In <a href="#cha:pia-laboratory">Chapter 7</a>, the exploration of <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s like the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> Change Discovery     <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> illustrates     the practical challenges and potential of scaling these technologies     for wider adoption. The successful implementation in     <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr>     demonstrates viability, but also points to the need for continued     development and community engagement to fully realise the benefits.</em></p>
<p><em>Furthermore, assessing the scalability of     <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> image     servers, as discussed by (Duin, 2022) and exemplified by     the firm Q42 with their Edge-based service Micrio<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>, highlights     the importance of optimising data performance. Erwin Verbruggen     aptly noted that ‘optimising data performance in my opinion mens sending as little data over as needed’<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup>, emphasising the need for efficient data     handling to enhance scalability. This insight reinforces the     necessity of continual refinement in scaling digital infrastructure     to support broader use and integration.</em></p>
<p>Reflecting on these findings, I would like to assert that continuous participation, particularly for institutions that can afford to be part of initiatives like <abbr title="IIIF Consortium">IIIF-C</abbr>, is essential. Active members should not only focus on their own use cases but also consider the needs and perspectives of other, perhaps marginalised, groups. Achieving the dual goals of making progress within one community, whether it be <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> or Linked Art, while also engaging in effective outreach and creating a solid baseline, will benefit everyone in the <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> sector and beyond. Addressing where <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> fits in, how people perceive this new concept or paradigm, and understanding how <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> differs from Linked Data in general are essential. These questions help to clarify the stages at which themes related to one of the <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> design principles emerge, crystallise, and potentially disappear. My thesis does not fully resolve these queries but offers insights and hints for further exploration.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the empirical findings reveal the richness of the implementation and maintenance of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> standards in the <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> domain. From the critical role of community practices and standards to the challenges of achieving interoperability and inclusivity, each theme underlines the complex interplay of social, technical and organisational factors. will look at the evaluation of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> and explore its overall impact, delving into the delta of what to do with it, particularly in terms of Linked Data versus <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr>, where my thesis provides pointers but does not provide definitive answers.</p>

<p>This chapter brings to a close the journey undertaken since February 2021, aiming to clearly articulate the answers to the research questions, discuss how the research aligns with the objectives, elucidate the significance of the work, outline its shortcomings, and suggest avenues for future research.</p>
<p>I had the privilege of hearing the above poem at EuropeanaTech in The Hague in October 2023. What struck me most, and what I have tried to convey in this thesis, was the powerful dialogue and collective spirit striving to harness the potential of our (digital) heritage. With a sense of conviction after this conference, I approached the next one in Geneva in February 2024 with confidence, believing that I had made a compelling case for the concept of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr>. When a participant asked how <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> differed from Linked Data, however, I found myself explaining the socio-technical ethos of <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art, the richness of the individuals who make them up, the ability to combine these different standards, and the common use cases that emerge from these collaborations. Whether my answer was convincing remains uncertain, but I knew it was too brief. Perhaps it is here, in this conclusion, that my thoughts can find their full expression.</p>
<p>I believe that <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> should be at the forefront of efforts to improve the accessibility and usability of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data, an endeavour that is increasingly relevant in a web-centric environment. This paradigm has gained considerable traction, particularly with the advent of Linked Art and the recognition that the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> Presentation <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> has been an inspiration for the <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> design principles. The development and maintenance of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> standards by dedicated communities are characterised by collaboration, consensus building, and transparency. In the interstices of the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art communities, frameworks for interoperability are not only exposed, but revealed as profound testaments to the power of transparent collaboration across institutional boundaries. Both communities, it is true, are still very much Anglo-Saxon efforts, where the specifications have mainly been implemented in <abbr title="Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums">GLAM</abbr> and/or <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> research projects, or at least when we have been aware of them. It has clear guidelines on how to propose use cases, mostly using GitHub, and hides the sometimes unnecessary <abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr> complexity behind a set of <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data">JSON-LD</abbr> <code>@ context</code>. <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> is at the presentation layer and can really play its role as a mediator, with the Manifest as its central unit connecting other specifications, including semantic metadata, and preferably with simpatico specifications such as Linked Art.</p>
<p>An important hypothesis arises from the observation that adherence to the <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> design principles makes specifications more likely to be adopted. The primary benefit of adopting <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> standards lies in their grassroots nature. This grassroots approach not only aligns with the core values of openness and collaboration within the <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> community but also serves as a common denominator between <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> practitioners and <abbr title="Cultural Heritage Institution">CHI</abbr>s. This unique alignment fosters a sense of shared purpose and common ground. However, it’s essential to acknowledge that while <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> and its associated standards, including IIIF, hold immense promise, their limited recognition in the wider socio-technical ecosystem may currently hinder their full potential impact beyond the <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> domain.</p>
<p>Consideration of socio-technical requirements and the promotion of digital equity are essential to the development of specifications in line with the <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> design principles. In the context of the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art communities, this means both recognising current challenges and building on existing practices. This includes forming alliances that support diverse forms of inclusion at both project and individual levels. For example, organisations should be encouraged to send representatives from diverse professional and personal backgrounds, such as underrepresented groups or non-technical fields. This can be facilitated by initiatives that lower the barriers to participation, such as financial support for travel and participation, flexible participation formats, and targeted outreach efforts. Furthermore, as these standards often align with open government data initiatives, they present opportunities for broader public engagement and institutional transparency.</p>
<p>In the broader context of <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr>, understanding <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> involves tracing the historical development of the field and its evolving relationship with technology. The interdisciplinary nature of <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> has always integrated diverse scholarly and technical practices. In recent years, <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> has seen a notable increase in interest in the use of Linked Data and semantic technologies to improve the discoverability and accessibility of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> collections. <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr>'s emphasis on user-centred design and usability aligns well with these goals. Consequently, the principles of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> hold great promise for advancing the integration and use of community-driven <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s and/or Linked Data within <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr>. This can be seen within <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr>, where the benefits of implementing <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> helped us to streamline machine-generated annotations, integrate different thumbnails into <abbr title="Graphical user interface">GUI</abbr> prototypes, model photo albums with different layers from the Kreis Family collection, and enable project members and students to engage in digital storytelling, an important participatory facet that can be seamlessly explored by <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> efforts and <abbr title="Cultural Heritage Institution">CHI</abbr>s with the help of the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> Image and Presentation <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s. Data reuse is definitely a key <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> driver, which could have been done more extensively with a productive instance of Linked Art. As for widening participation, this is definitely a strategic and political decision, rather than a technical one. That said, <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> specifications can definitely be embedded through strategic citizen science initiatives.</p>
<p>A recent example that highlights the comprehensive value of Linked Data was presented by (Newbury, 2024) at the <abbr title="Coalition for Networked Information">CNI</abbr> Spring 2024 Meeting. He delineated its significance as extending well beyond single entities, such as the Getty Research Institute, to enrich a vast ecosystem. Specifically, he identified three principal areas of value: Firstly, within the ecosystem itself, where the utility of information is amplified through its application in diverse contexts. Secondly, for the audience, by directly addressing user needs and facilitating various conceptual frameworks. And finally, within the community, by enabling wider use and adaptation of data and code. This approach to Linked Data, as articulated by Newbury, not only enhances its utility across these dimensions, but also aligns seamlessly with the <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> proposition, underscoring a shared vision for a digital space where the interconnectedness and accessibility of (meta)data serve as foundational principles for progress and community engagement.</p>
<p>LUX, as a catalyst for <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr>, exemplifies a practical approach to implementing Linked Data that has garnered significant local engagement and support at Yale. This initiative demonstrates how sound socio-technical practices can be effectively applied within a supportive institutional environment. The consistency of the data within LUX aligns well with <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art standards, with only a few minor adjustments required for full compliance. These quick fixes are manageable and do not detract from the overall robustness of the initiative. While it may be too early to fully assess the wider impact of using <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> specifications on the LUX platform within the <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> domain, the initiative has already attracted considerable interest in recent months. This growing attention suggests that the LUX approach is resonating with other organisations, suggesting the potential for wider adoption and impact. The enthusiastic local engagement at Yale provides a strong foundation for LUX and highlights its potential to serve as a model for similar projects aimed at enriching digital heritage through effective collaboration and agreed-upon standards.</p>
<p>In carrying out this thesis, I have adhered to the five main objectives set out at the beginning of the PhD. These objectives have been accomplished to a high degree, reflecting a substantial and well-executed project. Furthermore, most of the outputs – such as data models and scripts – from this work are available on GitHub, providing open access to the wider community. In addition, I have published several papers, both individually and collaboratively, further disseminating the findings and contributions of this research.</p>
<p>Additionally, this thesis is relevant because it sheds light on communities and implementations that can be celebrated not only for their standards but also for their operating ethos; <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art present models ripe for emulation beyond their immediate digital confines. Here, agency and authority are most typically granted to the collective over the isolated, with each actor - be it an individual, an institution or an interface – intricately interconnected. Yale’s LUX initiative also embodies this ethos, demonstrating how collaborative efforts can lead to innovative solutions and wider impact. It is to be hoped, then, that these practices of openness and multiple partnerships will not be seen as limited to their origins in digital representation. At the very least, I hope that these socio-technical approaches can serve as exemplars or sources of inspiration in broader arenas, where the principles of mutual visibility and concerted action can point the way towards cohesive and adaptive collaborative architectures.</p>
<p>Despite its contribution, this thesis is far from perfect and certainly contains several shortcomings. I will name here three significant ones. First, the visualisations included and the use of <abbr title="First-order logic">FOL</abbr> are primarily designed to support my own self-reflection and may be more beneficial to me than to the broader academic community. While they provide insights into my research process and findings, their applicability and usefulness to others might be limited. Second, the theoretical framework I employed, while instrumental to my research, may not serve as a universally applicable toolbox. Nevertheless, I urge readers to pay close attention to <abbr title="Science and Technology Studies">STS</abbr> methodologies and practices. The works of Bruno Latour, Donna Haraway, and Susan Leigh Star have been invaluable companions throughout this dissertation. Additionally, for those involved in conceptualising semantic information, I recommend exploring Floridi’s <abbr title="Philosophy of Information">PI</abbr>, which offers profound insights into the nature and dynamics of information. These readings have greatly influenced my approach and understanding, and I believe they can offer valuable perspectives to others as well. Third, while the thesis aims to address both community practices and semantic interoperability, it leans more heavily towards the former. This emphasis on community practices may overshadow the broader discussion of semantic interoperability, potentially limiting the appeal of the thesis to those primarily interested in the technical aspects.</p>
<p>Other shortcomings include the broad scope of the thesis, with three empirical chapters exploring different avenues. While this comprehensive approach provides a broad understanding of the research topic, it has also resulted in a rather lengthy thesis. This may be a challenge for the reader, as a topic of interest in one chapter may not be as compelling in another. The diversity of empirical focus, while enriching the research, may dilute the coherence for some readers, making it more difficult to maintain a consistent engagement throughout the dissertation. Despite these limitations, I hope that the different perspectives and findings contribute to a richer, more nuanced understanding of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> for <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>.</p>
<p>Avenues for future research are numerous and promising. One interesting area to explore is the comparative benefits experienced by early adopters of <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art specifications versus those who implemented these standards later. Early adopters have the advantage of having their use cases discussed and resolved within the community, and it would be insightful to analyse the long-term impacts on their projects. Such a study is already feasible for early adopters of <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and will become possible to compare further implementations of Linked Art within a few years. Furthermore, future exploration could focus on the full implementation of Linked Art within <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr> or similar efforts, as well as more performance-oriented testing with the deployed <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s. These efforts should further validate the robustness and scalability of these specifications. Another important area for future investigation is the participation of institutions and individuals from the Global South in both the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art communities. It is crucial to explore how we can better support their uptake of these specifications and encourage their active involvement in these initiatives to ensure a more inclusive and globally representative environment.</p>
<p>As I reflect on the journey of this thesis, I am reminded of the powerful dialogue and collective effort that has been at its heart. Mr Gee’s poem resonates deeply with my own aspirations for this work: to enhance our understanding of the past through openness and collaboration, as can be seen in <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art. As I bring this dissertation to a close, I am filled with a sense of accomplishment and a renewed commitment to promoting sound socio-technical practices. It is my hope that the insights and methodologies presented here will inspire others to engage in this ongoing dialogue, continually asking and answering the many questions that arise as we collectively explore our cultural heritage landscapes.</p>
