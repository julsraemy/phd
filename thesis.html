    <meta name="description" content="Digital technologies have fundamentally transformed how Cultural Heritage (CH) collections are accessed and engaged with. Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) specifications, including the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) Presentation API 3.0, Linked Art, and the Web Annotation Data Model (WADM), have emerged as web standards to facilitate the description and dissemination of these valuable resources. Despite the widespread adoption of IIIF, implementing LOUD specifications, particularly in combination, remains challenging. This is especially evident in the development and assessment of infrastructures, or sites of assemblage, that support these standards.
This research is guided by two perspectives: community practices and semantic interoperability. The first perspective assesses how organizations, individuals, and apparatuses engage with and contribute to the consensus-making processes surrounding LOUD. By examining these practices, the social fabrics of the LOUD ecosystem can be better understood. The second perspective focuses on making data meaningful to machines in a standardized, interoperable manner that promotes the exchange of well-formed information. This research is grounded in the SNSF-funded project, *Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives* (PIA) (2021–2025), which aims to develop a citizen science platform for three photographic collections from the Cultural Anthropology Switzerland (CAS) archives. Actor-Network Theory (ANT) forms the theoretical foundation, aiming to describe the collaborative structures of the LOUD ecosystem and emphasize the role of non-human actors.
Beyond its implementation within the PIA project, this research includes an analysis of the social dynamics within the IIIF and Linked Art communities and an investigation of Yale's Collections Discovery platform, LUX. The research identifies socio-technical requirements for developing specifications aligned with LOUD principles. It also examines how the implementation of LOUD standards in PIA highlights their potential benefits and limitations in facilitating data reuse and broader participation. Additionally, it explores Yale University's large-scale deployment of LOUD standards, emphasizing the importance of ensuring consistency between Linked Art and IIIF resources within the LUX platform for the CH domain.
The core methodology of this thesis is an actor- and practice-centered inquiry, focusing on a detailed examination of specific cosmologies within LOUD-driven communities, PIA, and LUX. This micro-perspective approach provides rich empirical evidence to unravel the intricate web of cultural processes and constellations in these contexts.
Key empirical findings indicate that LOUD enhances the discoverability and integration of data in CH, requiring community-driven consensus on model interoperability. However, significant challenges include engaging marginalized groups, sustaining long-term participation, and balancing technological and social factors. Strategic use of technology and the capture of digital materiality are critical, but LOUD also poses challenges related to resource investment, data consistency, and the broader implementation of complex patterns.
LOUD should lead efforts to improve the accessibility and usability of CH data. The community-driven methodologies of IIIF and Linked Art inherently foster collaboration and transparency, making these standards essential tools in evolving data management practices. Even for institutions and projects that do not adopt these specifications, the socio-technical practices of LOUD offer vital insights into effective digital stewardship and strategies for community engagement.">

<h2 id="cha:intro" tabindex="-1">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Since its inception in 2011, the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> has revolutionised<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> the accessibility of image-based resources. Initially driven by the needs of manuscript scholars, <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> focused on two-dimensional images, but has since expanded to encompass a wide range of image-based resources, including audiovisual materials and, in the near future, <abbr title="three-dimensional">3D</abbr> images. Similarly, Linked Art, formally established in 2017, initially concentrated on art museum objects but has since broadened its scope to model a variety of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> entities, leveraging <abbr title="CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model">CIDOC-CRM</abbr>, a renowned ontology in the museum and <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> space. Both initiatives aim to break down silos: <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> focuses on improving the presentation of digital objects, while both initiatives enhance their dissemination. Together, they make <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data more accessible through <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and more meaningful through Linked Art for machines. These efforts have primarily benefited the <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> domain.</p>
<p>A key commonality is that the main <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s these communities create align with the <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> design principles, either intentionally or empirically demonstrated through use cases. These principles enable software developers to develop compliant tools and services without needing to fully understand <abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr>, a syntax for representing information on the web. Additionally, they may not need to grasp all <abbr title="Linked Open Data">LOD</abbr> principles, which promote the interlinking of data from diverse datasets using tools like <abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr> such as thesauri. <abbr title="Web Annotation Data Model">WADM</abbr>, a <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> standard, is also recognised as a <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> specification. It provides a framework for creating interoperable annotations on web resources, facilitating the linking and sharing of data across different platforms and applications. These <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> design principles include the right abstraction for the audience, few barriers to entry, comprehensibility by introspection, documentation with working examples, and the use of many consistent patterns rather than few exceptions. Additionally, both <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art are driven by vibrant communities, mainly comprising <abbr title="Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums">GLAM</abbr> and higher education institutions.</p>
<p>While the standards and principles discussed have broad applications, it is important to clarify the scope of this dissertation. This work does not focus on <abbr title="Knowledge Graph">KG</abbr>s by assessing triplestores – databases specifically designed to store and retrieve triples, which are the fundamental data structures in <abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr>. Similarly, it does not deal with evaluating SPARQL engines, which are specifically designed to query <abbr title="Knowledge Graph">KG</abbr>s. Additionally, this dissertation does not address the intersection of <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> and <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr>, or the ontological reasoning of Linked Art.</p>
<p>Instead, this dissertation concentrates on <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr>, the consistency of its standards, design principles and the vibrant communities behind it. It examines <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data">JSON-LD</abbr> serialisation efforts and the crucial intersection required to establish robust semantic interoperability baselines between presentation and semantic layers. It also presents real-world use case implementations, both on a small scale in a laboratory and flexible space within the <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr> research project, and on a large scale at Yale, exemplified by the LUX platform that provides access to (meta)data from <abbr title="Yale University Library">YUL</abbr>, <abbr title="Yale Center for British Art">YCBA</abbr>, <abbr title="Yale University Art Gallery">YUAG</abbr>, and <abbr title="Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History">YPM</abbr>.</p>
<p>The focus is therefore on digital infrastructures capable of delivering <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data">JSON-LD</abbr> files from the above specifications, which are primarily, though not exclusively, <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> resources. It is more about the different actors – both human and non-human – that create and maintain these interconnected systems and the dynamic interactions that sustain them. The deployment of various <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> specifications addresses the need for semantic interoperability between <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> resources and disparate datasets by establishing a standardised approach to representing and linking data, ensuring that information can be seamlessly shared and understood across different platforms and contexts.</p>
<p>This dissertation seeks to carve out a distinct niche by addressing an often-overlooked aspect of <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art. <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> is sometimes perceived and studied merely as a service or an appendix, with the content it delivers taking precedence. However, this PhD thesis positions <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> as a first-class citizen worthy of in-depth study. Similarly, Linked Art, despite its potential and its relatively recent establishment, has been the subject of very few scholarly papers. This gap underscores the significance of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> in this context. Furthermore, this thesis elevates Linked Art to a position of primary importance, recognising its significance and advocating for its thorough examination. To thoroughly study <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> and its adherence to design principles, it is essential to immerse ourselves actively in both communities – an approach I have embraced for years. The thesis also emphasises the importance of participatory efforts and collaboration between research projects, which typically have shorter lifespans, and memory institutions, which need to implement technical standards as a <em>lingua franca</em>. In doing so, it reveals the mediating role of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> in advancing the heritage sphere. To truly understand <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr>, Linked Art, and to a lesser extent <abbr title="Web Annotation Data Model">WADM</abbr>, it is crucial to examine the social fabrics and consensus decision-making of each community. Among these considerations are how the specifications can be implemented pragmatically, and how the standards can support the implementation and maintenance of more extensive semantic interoperability efforts.</p>
<p>The significance of this research lies in highlighting the commitment and diligence of the individuals and organisations that make up both the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art communities. It aims to demonstrate that community-driven practices, such as those exemplified by <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art, have a potential that goes beyond the mere sharing of digital objects and their associated metadata. The more people who embrace these approaches and implement the associated specifications, the more society as a whole will benefit. Furthermore, this research illustrates that <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> is no longer limited to two-dimensional images, that Linked Art is not restricted to artworks, and that <abbr title="Web Annotation Data Model">WADM</abbr> is a simple, content-agnostic standard that can be easily integrated into a range of systems. This adaptability is a strength of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> standards, which are designed to be simple yet effective. <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> can serve a variety of purposes, primarily rooted in <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>, but with the potential to extend its benefits to other sectors. The true beauty of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> lies in its ability to foster networking opportunities and transparent socio-technical practices, demonstrating its value beyond mere technical implementation.</p>
<p>By emphasising these aspects, this dissertation highlights the wider impact of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> in promoting semantic interoperability and enhancing collaborative efforts within the heritage field and beyond. In addition, the implementation of standards through <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr> underlines the potential for similar participatory or citizen science projects, while the LUX initiative serves as an illustrative example of robust infrastructure and cross-unit engagement. These examples demonstrate the practical applications and far-reaching implications of adopting <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> standards in different contexts.</p>
<p>This dissertation is structured across ten chapters, each building upon the previous ones up to Chapter 5 to provide a comprehensive understanding of the research. These initial chapters lay the foundation of the study, establishing the context, theoretical framework, and methodological approaches. After this foundational section, Chapters 6, 7, and 8 present empirical studies that, while interconnected, can be read independently if desired. These chapters offer detailed insights into specific aspects of the research and can be appreciated on their own or as part of the broader narrative.</p>
<p>The thesis continues with <a href="#cha:context">Chapter 2</a>, which extends this introduction by providing more information about the research setting, specifically <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr>. <a href="#cha:literature">Chapter 3</a> follows with an extensive literature review, offering a comprehensive overview of methods to interlink <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data. Next, <a href="#cha:theoretical">Chapter 4</a> presents the theoretical framework, conceptualised as a toolbox and firmly rooted in <abbr title="Actor-Network Theory">ANT</abbr>, guiding the analysis and discussion throughout the dissertation. Following this, <a href="#cha:scope">Chapter 5</a> details the research scope and methodology, explaining the approaches and methods employed in the study.</p>
<p>Moving on to the empirical work, <a href="#cha:social-fabrics">Chapter 6</a> sheds light on the social fabrics of <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art, exploring the communities and practices that underpin these initiatives.<a href="#cha:pia-laboratory">Chapter 7</a> then examines the implementation of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> standards
within <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr>, highlighting the practical aspects and challenges encountered. This is followed by <a href="#cha:lux-consistency">Chapter 8</a>, which focuses on the LUX initiative at Yale, examining the underlying governance and interdepartmental ownership of the Yale Collections Discovery platform. The discussion of findings is presented in <a href="#cha:discussion">Chapter 9</a>, where the results from the empirical chapters are synthesised and analysed in relation to the theoretical framework. Finally, <a href="#cha:conclusion">Chapter 10</a> concludes
the thesis, summarising the key insights and contributions of the
research while outlining potential directions for future study.</p>
<h2 id="cha:context" tabindex="-1">2. Context</h2>
<p>In this chapter, I will set the stage for my PhD thesis by providing important background information. First, in <a href="#sec:title">Section 2.1</a>, I will explain why I chose the title for my thesis. This will give you an understanding of the main focus and the direction of my research. Next, in , I will describe the <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr> research project, which is central to my work. This section will cover the project’s goals, significance, and overall framework. In , I will detail my specific contributions to the <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr> project. I will emphasise how my work fits into the larger project and its importance to my thesis. Finally, in , I will talk about my active participation in the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art communities. This section will highlight how my involvement in these communities has influenced my research and its broader implications.</p>
<h3 id="sec:title" tabindex="-1">2.1 PhD Title</h3>
<p>I chose the title ‘Linked Open Usable Data for Cultural Heritage: Perspectives on Community Practices and Semantic Interoperability’ as it encapsulates the essence of my research focus but I could have indeed chosen other ones.</p>
<p>During the initial stages of my research, multiple working titles were explored to capture the diverse facets of my interests and objectives. If I was quite sure about having in the title after the third iteration, I was quite unsure of what should follow and if a subtitle was actually needed at all. Amidst this dynamic progression, the underlying theme of my research remained steadfast – to delve into the transformative potential of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> for <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>.</p>
<p>I also opted to maintain in the title of my thesis subsection. While holds its appeal, my choice reflects a broader narrative that acknowledges the crucial role of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage Institution">CHI</abbr>s and spotlighting the multifaceted nature of heritage preservation, encapsulating both its digital facets and the essential contribution of individuals and institutions in curating, interpreting, and making heritage accessible.</p>
<p>As for the subtitle, while I do explore <abbr title="Communites of Practice">CoP</abbr> as defined by (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991) and (Wenger, 2011) through investigating the social fabrics of the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art communities, my main interest lies in the broader application of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> for describing and interlinking <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> resources. Thus, I decided to opt for the more generic as the first axis or perspective.</p>
<p>For the second perspective, I wanted to see how semantic interoperability can be achieved through standards adhering to the <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> design principles, as they seem to be key enablers for seamless collaboration and knowledge exchange among practitioners. There was a time in my research when I envisaged decoupling and , perceiving them as two distinct dimensions. However, what really captivates me is the unification of these factors to facilitate collective reasoning for both humans and machines.</p>
<p>In summary, this title reflects my enthusiasm for using web-based and community-driven technologies to transform the way we understand, share and value <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>.</p>
<h3 id="sec:pia" tabindex="-1">2.2 The PIA Research Project</h3>
<p>I undertook my doctoral studies within the scope of the <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr> research project financed by the <abbr title="Swiss National Science Foundation">SNSF</abbr> under their Sinergia funding scheme from February 2021 to January 2025<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>. The project aimed to analyse the interplay of participants, epistemological orders and the graphical representation of information and knowledge in relation to three photographic collections from <abbr title="Cultural Anthropology Switzerland">CAS</abbr>. It sought to bring together the world of data and things in an interdisciplinary manner, exploring the phases of the analogue and digital archive from a cultural anthropological, technical and design research perspective (Felsing et al., 2023, p. 42). As part of this endeavour, interfaces were developed to enable the collaborative indexing and use of photographic archival records (Chiquet et al., 2023, p. 110). I discuss in more detail the interdisciplinary components and briefly introduce the people involved in the project in <a href="#subsec:interdisciplinary">Subsection 2.2.1</a>, then talk about the photographic collections that were the overarching narrative of the research in <a href="#subsec:sgv_collections">Subsection 2.2.2</a>, and lastly in <a href="#subsec:pia_vision">Subsection 2.2.3</a>, the vision that we had put together.</p>
<p>The project, divided in three interdisciplinary teams, was led by the University of Basel through the Institute for Cultural Anthropology and European Ethnology<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> (Team A) and the <abbr title="University of Basel's Digital Humanities Lab">DHLab</abbr><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> in collaboration with the <abbr title="Databases and Information Systems">DBIS</abbr> group (Team B) as well as by the <abbr title="Bern Academy of the Arts">HKB</abbr><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>, an art school and department of the Bern University of Applied Sciences (Team C) (Felsing et al., 2023, p. 43). <a href="#tab:pia-team">Table 2.1</a> lists the people who contributed to the project, broken down by the three teams and their particular perspectives.</p>

<h4 id="subsec:sgv_collections" tabindex="-1">2.2.2 Photographic Collections/Archives as Anchors</h4>
<p><abbr title="Cultural Anthropology Switzerland">CAS</abbr> has historically been engaged in active collaborations that bridge the academic research and the public sphere, primarily through traditional analogue methods. The <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr> project was created with the intention of exploring the complexities inherent in both analogue and digital approaches, and to encourage and investigate these collaborative endeavours between academia and the wider public. As such, <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr> represents a paradigm shift within the scope of projects associated with or supported by <abbr title="Cultural Anthropology Switzerland">CAS</abbr>, facilitating the seamless integration of digital tools to explore multiple facets of participation and engagement. This transformative endeavour embodies a profound exploration of new intersections where scholarly endeavours intertwine with the active involvement of citizens.</p>
<p><abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr> drew on three collections: one focusing on scientific cartography and titled (<em>Atlas der Schweizerischen Volkskunde</em>), a second from the estate of the photojournalist Ernst Brunner (1901–1979), and a third collection consisting of vernacular photography which was owned by the Kreis Family (1860–1970).</p>
<p><strong>SGV_05 <abbr title="The Atlas of Swiss Folklore">ASV</abbr></strong> consists of 292 maps and 1000 pages of commentary published from 1950 to 1995 — an example of such a map is shown in <a href="#fig:sgv-atlas">Figure 2.1</a>. This collection was commissioned by the <abbr title="Cultural Anthropology Switzerland">CAS</abbr> to do an extensive survey of the Swiss population in the 1930s and 1940s on many issues pertaining, for instance, to everyday life, local laws, superstitions, celebrations or labour (Weiss, 1940). The contents were compiled by researchers and by people who were described as <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>. Questions were asked about everyday habits, community rights, work, trade, superstitions, and many other topics&nbsp;(Schmoll, 2009b, 2009a). This collection offers a snapshot of everyday life in Switzerland right before the beginning of a modernisation process that fundamentally changed lifestyles in all areas during the postwar period. A digitised version of the <abbr title="The Atlas of Swiss Folklore">ASV</abbr> would not only allow the results of that time to be enriched with further findings &nbsp;(Felsing &amp; Frischknecht, 2021), but would also make transparent how knowledge was generated in cartographic form through a complex process along different types of media and actors. The restoration, digitisation, cataloguing and indexing efforts took all part throughout <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr> under the supervision of Birgit Huber, who extensively based her doctoral research on this particular collection (see Huber, 2023).</p>

<p><strong>SGV_10 Kreis Family</strong> comprises approximately 20,000 loose photographic objects, where a quarter of them are organised and kept in 93 photo albums — as illustrated by <a href="#fig:sgv-kreis">Figure 2.2</a>, from a wealthy Basel-based family and spanning from the 1850s to the 1980s. This private collection was acquired by <abbr title="Cultural Anthropology Switzerland">CAS</abbr> in 1991. The collection, which originally arrived in banana cases and was enigmatic due to the lack of clear organisation or accompanying information from the family, posed significant challenges. Despite these initial hurdles, <abbr title="Cultural Anthropology Switzerland">CAS</abbr> undertook meticulous efforts to catalogue and preserve its contents (Felsing &amp; Cornut, 2024, p. 42). The pictures were taken by studio photographers as well as by family members themselves. The Kreis Family collection represents a typical example of urban bourgeois culture and gives a comprehensive insight into the development of private photography over the course of a century&nbsp;(Pagenstecher, 2009). The photographic materials and formats are very diverse, ranging from prints to negatives, small, medium or large format photographs, black and white or colour. The collection also encompasses many photographic techniques, from the one-off daguerreotypes and ferrotypes, to the glass-based negatives that could be reproduced <em>en masse</em>, to the modern paper prints. While some of the albums and loose images were restored and digitised during the 2014 project, much of this work was completed during <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr> and overseen by Murielle Cornut, whose doctoral investigation was centred on the study of photo albums (see Cornut, 2023).</p>

<p><strong>SGV_12 Ernst Brunner</strong> is a donation of about 48,000 negatives and 20,000 prints to the <abbr title="Cultural Anthropology Switzerland">CAS</abbr> archives from Ernst Brunner, a self-taught photojournalist, who lived from 1901 to 1979 and who documented mainly in the 1930s and 1940s a wide range of folkloristic themes — as shown by <a href="#fig:sgv-brunner">Figure 2.3</a>. He is one of the most important photographers of the era and one of the most outstanding visual chroniclers of Swiss society&nbsp;(Pfrunder, 1995). His photographs show rural lifestyles, but also urban motifs. In his late work, he led the documentation and research on farmhouses in a specific Swiss district, a project initiated by <abbr title="Cultural Anthropology Switzerland">CAS</abbr>. Before Ernst Brunner became an independent photojournalist in the mid-1930s, he worked as a carpenter, influenced by the ideas of the <em>Bauhaus</em> and <em>Neues Bauen</em> movements. This can also be seen in the aesthetics and formal language of his photography. If all the black and white negatives were digitised and recorded between 2014 and 2018, the digitisation of prints, which is a selection done by Ernst Brunner, was conducted at the end of the <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr> research project. The latter was supervised by Fabienne Lüthi, whose PhD was about organisational systems and knowledge practices in the Ernst Brunner Collection.</p>

<p>Whereas for each of the PhD Candidates in Cultural Anthropology, a particular collection was assigned to them and its content was to varying degrees part of their subject of study, this was not exactly the same for the PhD Candidates in <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr>, including myself, and in Computer Science. Put differently, we had relative leeway in terms of what interested us in each or all of these three photographic collections. In my case, I briefly explain my contribution to the project more in and then in as part of the empirical portion of my thesis focusing on the deployment of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> specifications using the three <abbr title="Cultural Anthropology Switzerland">CAS</abbr> photographic collections.</p>
<p>Florian Spiess focused on the use of <abbr title="virtual reality">VR</abbr> through vitrivr, a multimedia retrieval system developed by the <abbr title="Databases and Information Systems">DBIS</abbr> research group at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science (Spiess et al., 2024; Spiess &amp; Schuldt, 2022; Spiess &amp; Stauffiger, 2023). His work included experiments with <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr>-related collections, such as the creation of virtual galleries clustered according to content-based similarity (see Peterhans et al., 2022). In the case of Max Frischknecht, his doctoral research centred on generative design<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup>, a methodology to visualise dynamic cultural archives. He mostly worked on the <abbr title="The Atlas of Swiss Folklore">ASV</abbr> collection and on a mapping tool which is a cartographic visualisation designed to explore the <abbr title="Cultural Anthropology Switzerland">CAS</abbr> photographic archives (see Frischknecht, 2022; Huber &amp; Frischknecht, 2024).</p>
<p>It should also be mentioned that not only did we use the three collections of the <abbr title="Cultural Anthropology Switzerland">CAS</abbr> photographic archives within the project, but that both formal and informal meetings took place most commonly within the photographic archives at the Spalenvorstadt premises in the old Gewerbemuseum and later either at the on Allschwilerstrasse, though less frequently, or at Rheinsprung where the Institute for Cultural Anthropology and European Ethnology is located. This meant that there was a strong and sometimes blurred entanglement between those involved in the archives and the <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr> core team members.</p>
<h4 id="subsec:pia_vision" tabindex="-1">2.2.3 Project Vision</h4>
<p>Between December 2021 and March 2022, we worked together to develop and finalise a vision for the project<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup>. It includes seven key priorities, or pillars, which were meant to strengthen the interdisciplinary perspectives of <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr>. Although ambitious, these elements were of paramount importance to us and served as a guiding blueprint for all <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr> activities. Hereafter is a modified version of the vision<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup> taken from (Cornut et al., 2023) [p. 4].</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Accessibility</strong> by developing open interfaces and offering the     possibility of expanding the archive and turning it into an     instrument of current research that collects and evaluates knowledge     with the participation of other users (Citizen Science).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Heterogeneity</strong> by making visible where, why and under what     circumstances the objects were created, how they were handled and     what path they have taken to get to and in the archive. We work on     visualisations that take into account the heterogeneous character of     archival materials and make their respective biographies visible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Materiality</strong> by conveying the material properties of the objects:     they have front and back sides, inscriptions, traces, development     errors, they are transparent, multi-layered or fabric-covered. They     tell of their origin, use, and peculiarities. We want to make this     knowledge accessible and understandable in digital form. To this     end, we also consider the necessary infrastructure involved in the     creation as part of their narrative: the restoration, the     relocation, the indexing, the storage devices, the research tools,     the display medium, as well as the process of repro-photography.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interoperability</strong> as a crucial component and which will be done     by supporting digital means that allow different stakeholders to     freely access and interact with the project’s data. Both humans and     machines can use, contribute to, correct and annotate the existing     data in an open and interoperable manner, thus encouraging exchange     and the creation of new knowledge. To do this, we use web-based     standards that are widely adopted in the cultural heritage field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Affinities</strong> by leveraging data models and pattern recognition     which can uncover semantic relationships between entities that were     previously incomplete or difficult for users to access. Using     specific interfaces and visualisations, we make it possible to     explore digital assets and discover forms of relationships and     similarities between images.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></strong> that     facilitates automated searches for simple image attributes such as     colour, shapes, and localisation of image components. It should also     become possible to recognise texts and object types for extracting     metadata.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bias Management</strong> by taking into account that associated metadata     was human-made<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup> and thus is never objective. Collections and     their metadata reflect biases or focus narrowly on selected areas     and perceptions. Machines working on the basis of such data     automatically reproduce the implicit biases in decision-making due     to so-called biased algorithms. Therefore, understanding the data     used for training and the algorithms applied for decision making is     crucial to ensure the integrity of the application of these     technologies in archives. We take ethical issues into account when     using <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> and     visualisations, because the higher the awareness of a possible bias,     the faster it can be detected or brought up for consideration with     users.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As my thesis is notably concerned with semantic interoperability, <strong>Interoperability</strong> and <strong>Affinities</strong> are of particular importance to my PhD thesis, although I recognise the importance of all pillars. Each of these resonated with me and my fellow PhD Candidates. As we immersed ourselves in the vision of the <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr> research project, it became a unifying thread that brought us together in our research ambitions. We found that all these priorities within the project spoke to us at different points and provided a strong point of communication and practice in the development of processes, prototypes or interfaces.</p>
<h4 id="#sec:pia-contribution" tabindex="-1">2.3 Contribution to PIA and its Relevance to the Thesis</h4>
<p>To develop a participatory platform, an open and sustainable technological foundation for facilitating the reuse of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> resources was needed (Raemy, 2021). Throughout the <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr> project, I was mainly involved in the extension of the data infrastructure, the uptake of <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> as well as designing the data model, leveraging Linked Art and <abbr title="Web Annotation Data Model">WADM</abbr> (Raemy, 2024). As a member of Team B, I undertook this PhD as a bridge between the different teams, mostly participating in discussions with the three doctoral candidates from Team A to further develop and agree on the <abbr title="Cultural Anthropology Switzerland">CAS</abbr> data model and with the software developers from my team to discuss the impact of the data model on our evolving — yet transitory — infrastructure as well as helping in implementing the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s adhering to the <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> design principles.</p>
<p>It was necessary to redesign the data model within the context of a database migration, from Salsah to the <abbr title="DaSCH Service Platform">DSP</abbr>, that happened between November 2021 and March 2024. This updated version, based on the Knora Base Ontology<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup>, corresponded to the needs of the <abbr title="Cultural Anthropology Switzerland">CAS</abbr> archives and to some extent to those of <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr>, in particular to enable the PhD Candidates in Cultural Anthropology to make more precise assertions, whether in terms of descriptive metadata, or in the ability to link one object to another or to provide comments on these objects in several narrative forms.</p>
<p>Moreover, an assessment of the appropriate technical standards for improved usability of the objects by both humans and machines was carried out, as a basis for extending the capabilities provided by <abbr title="Swiss National Data and Service Center for the Humanities">DaSCH</abbr>, such as helping the software developers to implement <abbr title="Simple Image Interface Presentation">SIPI</abbr><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">[12]</a></sup>, a <code>C++</code> image server compatible with the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> Image <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> and build services that create <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> Presentation API 3.0 resources.</p>
<p>While the theoretical framework of the thesis extends across the scope of <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr>, the empirical part focuses on a specific set of findings derived from the research project outlined in , under the title . In this chapter, I discuss the data model and its refinement as well as the generation of custom <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> Manifests during the specific digitisation, cataloguing and indexing efforts that took place throughout the project for the three <abbr title="Cultural Anthropology Switzerland">CAS</abbr> collections (SGV_05, SGV_10 and SGV_12) under investigation, the implementation of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> standards, and the overall design of the technological underpinnings.</p>
<h4 id="#sec:involvement_iiif_la" tabindex="-1">2.4 Involvement within the IIIF and Linked Art communities</h4>
<p>I must acknowledge the invaluable role that my involvement within the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art communities has played in shaping my journey as a trained information specialist and an aspiring <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> practitioner. Being an active participant in both communities has not only broadened my understanding of the latest developments in the field but has also profoundly influenced the trajectory of this dissertation.</p>
<p>I have been involved within the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> community since October 2016 and the Working Groups Meeting that happened in The Hague<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">[13]</a></sup>. This significant journey was, in fact, initiated by a recommendation from my first supervisor, Peter Fornaro, during my time as an undergraduate doing an internship at the <abbr title="University of Basel's Digital Humanities Lab">DHLab</abbr>. Little did I know that this recommendation would lead me to be carrying out a PhD and looking at <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> not only as community-driven standards but as an object of study. Engaging with the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> community exposed me to cutting-edge advances in image interoperability and standards, and fostered a deeper appreciation for the importance of digital representations of cultural heritage. Through collaborative discussions with experts from diverse backgrounds, I gained new perspectives on the potential of technology to advance humanities research and preserve our collective cultural memory.</p>
<p>Similarly, my involvement in the Linked Art community introduced me to the opportunities offered by <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> and its transformative impact on research discourse. Exposure to Linked Data methodologies and the <abbr title="CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model">CIDOC-CRM</abbr> has significantly influenced the way I have structured and interpreted the data in this dissertation, thereby enriching its scholarly breadth and rigour. I started to be actively involved in Linked Art at the beginning of my PhD in 2021, but I was already a by 2020, driven by the efforts of Rob Sanderson, my third supervisor. By mid-2023, I had become a member of the Editorial Board.</p>
<p>The individuals I have met and the knowledge shared in these vibrant communities have deeply informed my approach as a scholar. The invaluable connections and collaborations I have made have expanded my network of fellow researchers, educators, and experts, leading to fruitful discussions that have significantly shaped the research questions addressed in this thesis. The events and workshops organised by these communities have also provided immersive learning experiences, giving me first-hand insights into the tools, technologies and methodologies used in the context of describing and disseminating <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data. The dynamic ecosystem of these communities has served as an inspiring backdrop, fostering innovative thinking and encouraging a more holistic approach to my research.</p>
<h2 id="cha:literature" tabindex="-1">3. Interlinking Cultural Heritage Data</h2>
<p>Interlinking <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data is an important aspect of publishing heritage collections over the web, in particular by using <abbr title="Linked Open Data">LOD</abbr> technologies to make assertions more easily readable and meaningful to machines (Marcondes, 2021). Due to the complexity of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data and their intrinsic inter-relationships, it is necessary to define its nature and introduce controlled vocabularies and ontologies that can be integrated with existing web standards and interoperable with relevant platforms (Bruseker et al., 2017; Hyvönen, 2020).</p>
<p>Efforts to interlink <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data have brought about significant advancements, but challenges remain. One such challenge is finding a balance between completeness and precision of expression to ensure that the that <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data remain accessible and usable to a wider audience. Addressing this challenge, the Linked Open Usable Data (<abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr>) design principles and the specifications that adhere to those, such as the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> Presentation <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> 3.0 and Linked Art, offer a promising approach (Raemy et al., 2023). By focusing on usability aspects from the perspective of software developers and data scientists involved in designing visualisation tools and data aggregation approaches, <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> strives to enhance the overall user experience (Sanderson, 2019).</p>
<p>Finding this equilibrium becomes crucial as <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data continues to grow in complexity and size, necessitating the seamless integration of native web technologies. The <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> concept cultivates an environment that encourages the formation of vibrant <abbr title="Communites of Practice">CoP</abbr> and the seamless integration of native web technologies, wherein an essential principle is the availability of comprehensive documentation supplemented with practical examples (Raemy, 2022). Moreover, the emphasis on leveraging widely adopted technologies enhances the interoperability of data and promotes its wider dissemination. With <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> principles guiding the linking of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data, the resulting web of knowledge becomes more than just a machine-readable resource; it transforms into a user-centric ecosystem where both accessibility of Linked Data and usability intersect to enable scholars and a wider audience to engage in the exploration and appreciation of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> (Newbury, 2018). Finally, by fostering a collaborative, knowledge-sharing mindset, <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> empowers software developers to implement data in a robust way, drawing insights from shared experiences (see Page et al., 2020).</p>
<p>In this chapter, which serves as the literature review of the PhD thesis, I attempt to draw on this brief introduction by dividing the insights into seven sections in order to provide an overview of the key concepts related to interlinking data in the <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> domain. The literature review primarily encompasses works published up until December 2023, providing a comprehensive snapshot of the field’s current state and its evolution. <a href="#sec:standout">Section 3.1</a> discusses what makes <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data stand out and <a href="#sec:metadata">Section 3.2</a> is about <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> metadata standards, while ??? explores the technological trends, scientific movements and guiding principles that have shaped the field. ??? provides an overview of the web as an open platform, which are essential to understanding the current landscape of interlinking <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data. ??? focuses on <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr>, while ??? looks at characterising the community practices and semantic interoperability dimensions for <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>. Finally, in ???, I summarise key elements from each section and within each of these I give some initial thoughts with respect to <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr>, and then conclude the chapter with some considerations on why we as a society need to care about <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data.</p>
<h3 id="sec:standout" tabindex="-1">3.1 What Makes Cultural Heritage Data Stand Out?</h3>
<p>Here, I aim to establish the indirect territory of my study, as I am situated on a distinct plane that focuses on web technologies and standards — as well as software and services that enable them — as the subjects of investigation. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> specifications owe their existence to the available data that have served as case studies. Thus, their significance can be best understood through the lens of data and I recognise here the pivotal role played by <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> practitioners — encompassing individuals from research and memory institutions — who have had a significant impact on specifying a series of web-based standards and who have helped to move forward the discovery of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data and beyond, in particular those belonging to the public domain, in an open manner.</p>
<p>In <a href="#subsec:cultural-heritage">Subsection 3.1.1</a>, I provide an introduction to <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> as recognised by the <abbr title="United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization">UNESCO</abbr>. I explore the tangible, intangible, and natural dimensions of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>, laying the foundation for further discussions on its representation and preservation, notably by giving a first definition of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data. Next in <a href="#subsec:reprez">3.1.2</a>, I look at the challenges of representation and embodiment of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data. This subsection examines the challenges in describing and preserving its materiality or embodied aspects. Understanding the significance of collective efforts, communities, and the interplay of technologies. Thirdly, I discuss what I called ‘Collectives and Apparatuses’ in <a href="#subsec:collective-apparatus">3.1.3</a> where I highlight how actors in terms of collaborative actions and apparatuses play a pivotal role in <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>.</p>
<h4 id="subsec:cultural-heritage" tabindex="-1">3.1.1 Cultural Heritage</h4>
<p>The legacy of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> encompasses physical artefacts and intangible aspects inherited from past generations, reflecting the history and traditions of societies. Meanwhile, <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> constantly evolves due to complex historical processes, necessitating preservation and protection efforts to prevent its loss over time (Loulanski, 2006). The dynamic nature of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> demands collaborative actions, including documentation and the use of a range of technologies.</p>
<p>The concept of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> is also characterised by perpetual evolution, mirroring the historical processes that shape societies over time. Social, political, economic, and technological shifts invariably influence the definition and perception of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>, prompting continuous reinterpretations and reevaluations of its significance. Over the years, the enthusiasm for the protection of cultural property has enriched the term with new shades of meaning. As societies undergo transformations, new layers of meaning and relevance are superimposed on existing <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>, perpetually enriching its essence. As articulated by (Ferrazzi, 2021, p. 765):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Cultural heritage’, as an abstract legacy or as a merge of tangible and intangible values, is able to encompass the totality of culture(s); in so, assuming a symbolic value that brings a clear break with all other terminologies. In conclusion, ‘cultural heritage’ as a legal term has demonstrated more than any others to be a real ensemble of historical stratification and cultural diversity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The advent of globalisation and rapid advancements in technology have further accelerated the evolution of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>. Increased interconnectedness and cross-cultural interactions have led to the fusion of traditions and the emergence of novel cultural expressions. Moreover, the digital era has facilitated the dissemination of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> resources on a global scale, transcending geographical barriers and preserving cultural knowledge for future generations as (Portalés et al., 2018).</p>
<p>Thus, the intriguing nature of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> resources can be attributed to their multifaceted and diverse characteristics. The conservation and promotion of these resources demand a nuanced comprehension of the various types of heritage resources, culminating in effective preservation and promotion strategies that can account for their heterogeneity (Windhager et al., 2019).</p>
<p>According to (UNESCO Institute for Statistics, 2009), <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> includes tangible and intangible heritage. Tangible <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> refers to physical objects such as artworks, artefacts, monuments, and buildings, while intangible <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> comprises practices, knowledge, folklore and traditions that hold cultural significance (Munjeri, 2004). The concept of heritage has evolved through a process of extension to include objects that were not traditionally considered part of the heritage. The criteria for selecting heritage have also changed, taking into account cultural value, identity, and the ability of the object to evoke memory. This shift has led to the recognition and protection of intangible <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>, challenging a Eurocentric perspective and embracing cultural diversity as a valuable asset for humanity (Vecco, 2010).</p>
<p>Conservation guidelines have broadened the concept of heritage to include not only individual buildings and sites but also groups of buildings, historical areas, towns, environments, social factors, and intangible heritage (Ahmad, 2006). In 2019, another instance of <abbr title="United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization">UNESCO</abbr> defines <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> in an even more comprehensive manner, taking into account natural heritage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cultural heritage is, in its broadest sense, both a product and a process, which provides societies with a wealth of resources that are inherited from the past, created in the present and bestowed for the benefit of future generations. Most importantly, it includes not only tangible, but also natural and intangible heritage. (UNESCO. Culture for Development Indicators, 2014, p. 130)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In thinking about the concept of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>, I find this last definition particularly resonant. This broader perspective is motivated by my interest with <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> specifications as a research area, particularly because of their notable data agnosticism and as it resonated with (Hyvönen, 2012) [pp. 1-3]'s subdivision of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> as well. These services have the adaptability to process and use different types of data, transcending the boundaries of specific domains or disciplines. Although grounded in concrete <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> cases, their potential to extend to any type of data, including those from STEM, is a compelling prospect that warrants further exploration, a point that I will explore later.</p>
<p>The following sub-subsections aim to briefly discuss tangible, intangible, and natural heritage, as well as providing a definition of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data which can serve as a foundational reference for this thesis.</p>
<h5 id="subsubsec:tangible" tabindex="-1">3.1.1.1 Tangible Heritage</h5>
<p>Tangible <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> encompasses physical artefacts and sites of immense cultural significance that are passed through generations in a society (Vecco, 2010). These objects are tangible manifestations of human creativity, representing artistic creations, architectural achievements, archaeological remains as well as collections held by <abbr title="Cultural Heritage Institution">CHI</abbr>s.</p>
<p>One aspect of tangible <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> is artistic creations such as paintings, sculptures and traditional handicrafts. These artefacts embody cultural values and artistic expressions and serve as essential reflections of a society’s collective ethos. For example, artworks such as ‘Irises’ from Vincent van Gogh<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">[14]</a></sup> and Alberto Giacometti’s ‘L’Homme qui Marche I’ <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">[15]</a></sup> are revered works of art that have deep cultural significance in Europe and all over the world.</p>
<p>The built heritage, including monuments, temples and historic buildings, is another important component of the tangible <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>. These architectural marvels not only represent past civilisations, but also convey the social values and aspirations of their time. The Taj Mahal, an exemplary white marble structure in India, stands as a poignant testament to Mughal architecture. Closer to where I write this dissertation one can mention the Abbey of St Gall, a convent from the century which is inscribed on the <abbr title="United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization">UNESCO</abbr> World Heritage List. In the context of urban heritage, conventional definitions of built heritage often focus narrowly on the architectural and historical value of individual buildings and monuments, which are well protected by existing legislation. However, the challenge is to preserve urban fragments - areas within towns and cities that may not qualify as designated conservation areas, but are of significant cultural and morphological importance (Tweed &amp; Sutherland, 2007). For instance, (Rautenberg, 1998) proposes two categories of built <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>: heritage by designation and heritage by appropriation. Heritage by designation involves experts conferring heritage status on sites, buildings, and cultural objects through a top-down approach, often without public participation. This method can be predictable and uncontroversial, but can be criticised for being elitist and neglecting unconventional heritage. On the other hand, heritage by appropriation emphasises community and public involvement in identifying and preserving cultural expressions, leading to a more inclusive and dynamic understanding of heritage.</p>
<p>Archaeological sites are also an integral part of the tangible <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>, offering invaluable insights into past societies and ways of life. As per May 2024, <abbr title="United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization">UNESCO</abbr>'s long list of World Heritage Sites includes 1,199 cultural and natural sites in 168 different state parties — including 48 sites in transboundary regions<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">[16]</a></sup>. Sites such as Machu Picchu, an impressive Inca citadel in the Peruvian Andes, bear witness to the architectural achievements and cultural practices of ancient civilisations. If archaeological sites are invaluable, they face significant threats such as looting, destruction, exploitation, and extreme weather phenomena (Bowman, 2008; Micle, 2014). To safeguard them, conservation efforts must be case-specific and include documentation and assessment of experiences gained (Aslan, 1997).</p>
<p>The preservation of tangible <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> extends beyond physical objects to include libraries, archives and museums that house collections of books, manuscripts, historical documents and artefacts.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the term “cultural property” is also employed as a related concept to tangible <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>, encompassing both movable and immovable properties as opposed to less tangible cultural expressions (Ahmad, 2006). Cultural property is protected by a number of international conventions and national laws. For instance, the Blue Shield<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">[17]</a></sup> — an international organisation established in 1996 by four non-governmental organisations<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">[18]</a></sup> — aims to protect and preserve heritage in times of armed conflict and natural disasters (Van der Auwera, 2013). Its mission has been revised in 2016:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Blue Shield is committed to the protection of the world’s cultural property, and is concerned with the protection of cultural and natural heritage, tangible and intangible, in the event of armed conflict, natural- or human-made disaster. (Blue Shield, 2016 art. 2.1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall, tangible <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> is a testament to human ingenuity and cultural diversity, and serves as a bridge between the past and the present. Its preservation is a collective responsibility, ensuring that the legacy of past generations endures and the wealth of cultural diversity continues to enrich the fabric of society.</p>
<h5 id="subsubsec:intangible" tabindex="-1">3.1.1.2 Intangible Heritage</h5>
<p>The concept of intangible heritage emerged in the 1970s and was coined at the <abbr title="United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization">UNESCO</abbr> Mexico Conference in 1982 (Leimgruber, 2010) with the aim of protecting cultural expressions that were previously excluded from preservation efforts (Hertz et al., 2018). <abbr title="United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization">UNESCO</abbr>'s previous focus had been on material objects, primarily from wealthier regions of the global North, leaving the intangible cultural heritage of the South overlooked. Attempts to protect intangible heritage through legal measures like copyright and patents were ineffective due to the collective nature of these cultural expressions and the anonymity of creators. The Convention acknowledges that intangible <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> is essential for cultural diversity and sustainable development.</p>
<p>Below is the definition given by the <em>Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘The Intangible Cultural Heritage’ means the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, skills – as well as the instruments, objects, artefacts and cultural spaces associated therewith – that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognize as part of their cultural heritage. This intangible cultural heritage, transmitted from generation to generation, is constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment, their interaction with nature and their history, and provides them with a sense of identity and continuity, thus promoting respect for cultural diversity and human creativity. (UNESCO, 2022)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to <abbr title="United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization">UNESCO</abbr>, intangible <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> can be manifested in the following domains:</p>
<ul>
<li>oral traditions and expressions, including language as a vehicle of     the intangible <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>;</li>
<li>performing arts;</li>
<li>social practices, rituals and festive events;</li>
<li>knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe;</li>
<li>traditional craftsmanship.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, intangible <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> is a multifaceted concept that encompasses both traditional practices inherited from the past and contemporary expressions in which diverse cultural groups actively participate (Leimgruber, 2008; Munjeri, 2004). It includes inclusive elements shared by different communities, whether they are neighbouring villages, distant cities around the world, or practices adapted by migrant populations in new regions. These expressions have been passed down from generation to generation, evolving in response to their environment, and play a crucial role in shaping our collective identity and continuity. Intangible <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> promotes social cohesion, strengthens a sense of belonging and responsibility, and enables individuals to connect with different communities and society at large.</p>
<p>Central to the nature of intangible <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> is its representation within communities. Its value goes beyond mere exclusivity or exceptional importance; rather, it thrives on its association with the people who preserve and transmit their knowledge of traditions, skills and customs to others within the community and across generations. The recognition and preservation of intangible <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> depends on the communities, groups or individuals directly involved in its creation, maintenance and transmission. Without their recognition, no external entity can decide on their behalf whether a particular practice or expression constitutes their heritage. The community-based approach ensures that intangible <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> remains authentic and deeply rooted in the living fabric of society, protected by those who care for and perpetuate it.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, the Winegrower’s Festival in Vevey (<em>La Fête des Vignerons</em>), a plurisecular event celebrating the world of wine making (Vinck, 2019) and the Carnival of Basel (<em>Basler Fasnacht</em>) (Chiquet, 2023) are examples of traditions that are listed among <abbr title="United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization">UNESCO</abbr>'s intangible <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>.</p>
<p>(In)tangibility is not always a straightforward concept and can indeed be blurred, i.e. it goes beyond the mere idea of materialisation. Many artefacts and elements of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> possess both tangible and intangible qualities that intertwine and complement each other, making the distinction less clear-cut.</p>
<p>For instance, this Male Face Mask, held at the Art Institute Chicago<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">[19]</a></sup>, also known as ‘Zamble’, from the Guro people in the Ivory Coast holds dual significance as both a tangible and intangible <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>. As a tangible object, the mask is a physical artefact made from wood and pigment, fabric, and various adornments, that combines animal and human features representing the Guro people’s artistic skills. On the other hand, as an intangible cultural object, the Zamble mask carries profound spiritual and cultural meaning. It plays a significant role in commemorating the deceased during a man’s second funeral. These second funerals are organised months or even years after the actual burial as a way to honour and remember the departed (see Haxaire, 2009). Thus, the preservation and appreciation of both the tangible and intangible aspects of the mask are essential to its cultural relevance.</p>
<p>Another example of the blurred line between tangible and intangible heritage is emphasised by (De Muynke et al., 2022) in recreating reported perceptions of the acoustics of Notre-Dame de Paris through a collaboration between sciences of acoustics and anthropology. The authors highlight the heritage value of how people subjectively perceive sound in a space, particularly in places of worship where sound and music are integral to the religious experience. The authors advocate integrating the study of both material and non-material aspects to understand the changing sonic environments of heritage buildings [(De Muynke et al., 2022) pp. 1-2]. (Katz, 2023) articulates that <em>‘acoustics is an intangible product of a tangible building’</em>. This integrated perspective could lead to a more holistic understanding of the dynamics between physical spaces and the perceptual and experiential dimensions attached to them.</p>
<h5 id="subsubsec:natural" tabindex="-1">3.1.1.3 Natural Heritage</h5>
<p>Natural heritage, encompassing geological formations, biodiversity, and ecosystems of cultural, scientific, and aesthetic value, shares a significant overlap with <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>. Many natural sites hold spiritual and symbolic importance for communities, becoming repositories of cultural memory and identity (Lowenthal, 2005). Traditional ecological knowledge developed by various cultures also underscores the interconnectedness of cultural and natural heritage, as indigenous communities have accumulated wisdom on sustainable resource use and ecological balance (Azzopardi et al., 2023). Moreover, the conservation and sustainable management of natural heritage is often intertwined with efforts to protect <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>, fostering a collective commitment to preserve these entangled legacies for future generations.</p>
<p>The link between natural and <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> goes beyond their shared values; spatial overlaps further accentuate their interdependence. Natural sites may have cultural significance, while <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> sites may be situated within natural landscapes. For example, a national park may include archaeological sites or culturally revered landscapes, thus intertwining the cultural and natural dimensions. This spatial intermingling highlights the inextricable relationship between human societies and the natural environment, as cultural practices and beliefs become intertwined with the landscapes they inhabit. In this way, the preservation of both natural and cultural heritage becomes essential not only for their intrinsic worth but also for sustaining the narrative of our shared human and environmental history.</p>
<p>Additionally, the distinction between nature and culture is not only subjective and dependent on human appreciation (Vandenhende &amp; Van Hoorick, 2017). Rather, it is a concept intrinsically linked with the overarching framework of modernism, a perspective that has been critically examined and deconstructed by the influential sociologist and philosopher, Bruno Latour, that have argued that <em>‘we have never been modern’</em> (Latour, 1993). Latour’s deconstruction of the modernist perspective extends to the recognition that the <em>‘the proliferation of hybrids has saturated the constitutional framework of the moderns’</em> (Latour, 1993, p. 51). This assertion underscores the fundamental challenge posed by hybrid entities – those that blur the boundaries between nature and culture – to the traditional categories upon which modernist thinking has been predicated. In essence, the concept of hybrids disrupts the neat divisions between the natural and social worlds that have been a hallmark of modernist discourse and provide us an opportunity to situate ourselves as ‘amodern’ as opposed to postmodern (Latour, 1990).</p>
<p>In addition to Latour’s critique of the modernistic distinction between nature and culture, the concept of the ‘parasite’, as expounded by Michel Serres, one of the influential thinkers who significantly influenced Latour’s intellectual development (Berressem, 2015). It offers a valuable lens through which to examine the intricacies of interconnectedness and interdependence within our world. In his view, everything is enmeshed in a complex web of relationships that negates the existence of self-contained entities. Rather than seeing discrete and isolated entities, Serres invites us to see everything as an integral part of a larger system in which each component is inextricably dependent on the others (Serres, 2014). Together, these complementary perspectives invite us to reevaluate our understanding of the intricate tapestry of existence, emphasising the complexities of our relationship with the world.</p>
<p>Thus, the appreciation of nature and culture is not mutually exclusive, but rather forms a continuous and evolving relationship. The modern perspective has historically separated these realms, treating them as distinct and disconnected. However, a more inclusive approach dissolves this artificial boundary and recognises the interconnectedness of nature and culture (Donna Haraway, 2008; Donna Jeanne Haraway, 2016). This paradigm shift challenges the traditional modern understanding and invites a more holistic view in which natural and cultural heritage are mutually constructed within a complex network of relationships.</p>
<p>Recognition of this relationship is essential in the context of heritage conservation and understanding. The dynamic interplay between nature and culture is recognised, and the acknowledgement of their coexistence promotes a more holistic approach to heritage conservation, where cultural practices, traditions and ecological systems are seen as interdependent aspects of the wider heritage tapestry. This recognition encourages us to see heritage sites not as isolated entities, but as part of a larger web of interconnectedness, and urges us to conserve and value both cultural and natural heritage with a shared responsibility. Adopting this interconnected perspective enables us to appreciate the profound connections between human societies and the natural world, and inspires a collective commitment to safeguarding these precious legacies for future generations.</p>
<h5 id="subsubsec:chd" tabindex="-1">3.1.1.4 Cultural Heritage Data</h5>
<p>As I embark on the exploration of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data, it is first necessary to establish a basic understanding of data in this context. At its core, data represents more than mere numbers and facts; it constitutes a collection of discrete or continuous values that are assembled for reference or in-depth analysis. In essence, data are the rich tapestry upon which the narratives of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> are woven, making its comprehension a critical prerequisite for our expedition into this domain.</p>
<p>Luciano Floridi — a prominent philosopher in the field of information and digital ethics — provides a thorough perspective on the term ‘data’ and offers valuable insights into its fundamental nature in its <abbr title="Philosophy of Information">PI</abbr>. He perceives <em>‘data at its most basic level as the absence of uniformity, whether in the real world or in some symbolic system. Only once such data have some recognisable structure and are given some meaning can they be considered information’</em> (Floridi, 2010). This initial definition sets the stage for a deeper exploration of Floridi’s understanding of data, as he further focuses on its transformative journey into a more meaningful and structured form, which we will explore next.</p>
<p>Building upon Floridi’s foundational concept of data as the absence of uniformity, his subsequent definition provides a more comprehensive perspective. In a previous work, (Floridi, 2005) [p. 357] argues that <em>‘data are definable as constraining affordances, exploitable by a system as input of adequate queries that correctly semanticise them to produce information as output’</em>. This definition highlights the dynamic role of data, not only as raw entities awaiting structure and meaning but also as elements imbued with the potential to constrain and guide systems towards the generation of meaningful information.</p>
<p>Transitioning from Floridi’s concept of data, we progress to the view that data can be notably seen as interpretable texts within the <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> perspective. According to (Owens, 2011)  there are four main perspectives on how Humanists can engage with data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data as constructed artefacts</strong>: data are a product of human creation, not something inherently raw or neutral;</li>
<li><strong>Data as interpretable texts</strong>: Humanists can interpret data as     authored works, considering the intentions of the creators and how     different audiences understand and use the data;</li>
<li><strong>Data as processable information</strong>: data can be processed by computers, allowing various forms of visualisation, manipulation and     analysis, which can lead to further perspectives and insights;</li>
<li><strong>Data can hold evidentiary value</strong>: data, as a form of human artefact and cultural object, can provide evidence to support claims     and arguments.</li>
</ul>
<p>These considerations highlight the multifaceted nature of data within the field of <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr>. It is in this complex landscape that we recognise that data transcends its traditional role as a passive entity. As (Rodighiero, 2021) [p. 26, citing (Akrich et al., 2006)] suggests that <em>‘there is no doubt that data are full-fledged actors that take part in the social network the actor-network theory describes, in which both human and non-human intertwine and overlap’</em>. This notion – rooted and borrowed from <abbr title="Science and Technology Studies">STS</abbr> – reinforces the idea that data, as an active and dynamic entity, plays a significant role in shaping the interactions between human and non-human actors in any digital spheres.</p>
<p>From these angles, I can look at the characteristics of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data. (Bruseker et al., 2017) [p. 94] articulate that <em>‘data coming from the cultural heritage community comes in many shapes and sizes. Born from different disciplines, techniques, traditions, positions, and technologies, the data generated by the many different specializations that fall under this rubric come in an impressive array of forms’</em>.</p>
<p>In exploring <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data, it is important to recognise the inherent diversity stemming from diverse disciplines, techniques, and traditions. (Bruseker et al., 2017) [p. 94] aptly emphasise this, highlighting the extensive array of forms in which data manifests. This heterogeneity raises fundamental questions about the unity and identity of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data — a crucial aspect deserving acknowledgement within this context. As the authors astutely ponder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It could be a natural problem to pose from the beginning: if the data of this community indeed presents itself in such a state of heterogeneity, does it not beg the question if there is truly an identity and unity to cultural heritage data in the first place? It could be argued that Cultural Heritage, as a term, offers a fairly useful means to describe the fuzzy and approximate togetherness of a wide array of disciplines and traditions that concern themselves with the human past.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Expanding on these insights, <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data refer to digital or data-driven affordances of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">[20]</a></sup>, embodying a rich and varied compilation of insights originating from a variety of disciplines, techniques, traditions, positions and technologies. It encompasses both tangible and intangible aspects of a society’s culture as well as natural heritage. These data, derived from a wide range of disciplines, offer a latent capacity to support the generation of knowledge relating to historical time periods, geospatial areas, as well as current and past human and non-human activities. They are collected, curated and maintained by various entities such as libraries, archives, museums, higher education institutions, non-governmental organisations, indigenous communities and local groups as well as by the wider public.</p>
<p>Building further on the mosaic of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data, three primary dimensions come to the fore: heterogeneity, knowledge latency, and custodianship.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Heterogeneity</strong>:   As a fundamental characteristic, signifies the diverse forms and     origins that shape this invaluable reservoir of human heritage.     Different techniques and varying viewpoints in treating modelling     also contribute to this heterogeneity (Guillem et al., 2023).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Knowledge latency</strong>:   It highlights the temporal dimension, presenting     <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data as a     repository of latent knowledge awaiting discovery and     interpretation. Notably, not all artefacts are – or should be –     digitised, and even among those that are, (mis)representation and     challenges in interconnecting them persist     (Rossenova &amp; Di Franco, 2022). Besides, the issue of structured data     – or the lack of it – reinforces the aspect of knowledge latency     (Hacıgüzeller et al., 2021).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Custodianship</strong>:   This dimension reinforces the essential role played by a variety of     entities, predominantly <abbr title="Cultural Heritage Institution">CHI</abbr>s, in safeguarding and managing     resources, ensuring their preservation and accessibility for present     and future generations. However, it is very important to acknowledge     the great divide in terms of resources, with indigenous and local     communities often facing challenges in custodianship     responsibilities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Taken together, these dimensions contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the nuanced fabric of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data. They reveal the diversity of forms and origins, the temporal aspects and the responsible stewardship that are crucial to the sustainability of such data.</p>
<p>By shifting our focus to the sphere of humanities data, we broaden our scope to extend beyond the peculiarities of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data. Drawing parallels between these areas allows us to grasp the interconnectedness of our heritage.</p>
<p><abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data usually refers to information about cultural artefacts, sites, and practices that hold historical or cultural significance. Humanities data encompasses information about human culture, history, and society, including literature, philosophy, art, and language (Tasovac et al., 2020). Both often involve ethical considerations, such as ownership, access, and preservation, and require a comprehensive understanding of their various meanings and values (Ioannides &amp; Davies, 2019). Moreover, (Schöch, 2013) explains that data in the humanities, such as text and visual elements, have unique qualities. While these analogue forms could be considered data, they lack the ability to be analysed computationally as they are non-discrete. The semiotic nature of language, text and art introduces dimensions tied to meaning and context, making the term ‘data’ problematic. Critics question its use because it conflicts with humanistic principles such as contextual interpretation and the subjective position of the scholar.</p>
<p>(Schöch, 2013) distinguish data in the humanities further into two core types: smart and big data. The former tends to be small in volume, carefully curated, but harder to scale such as digital editions. As for the latter, it describes voluminous and varied data and it loosely relies on the three ⋁ by  volume, velocity and variety (see <a href="#subsubsec:big_data">3.3.1.2</a>). Yet, big data in the humanities differs significantly from other fields as it rarely requires rapid real-time analysis, is less focused on handling massive volumes, and instead deals with diverse, unstructured data sources. (Schöch, 2013) concludes by arguing that <em>‘I believe the most interesting challenge for the next years when it comes to dealing with data in the humanities will be to actually transgress this opposition of smart and big data. What we need is bigger smart data or smarter big data, and to create and use it, we need to make use of new methods’</em>.</p>
<p>Data processing offers great potential for humanities research as (Owens, 2011) argues: <em>‘In the end, the kinds of questions humanists ask about texts and artifacts are just as relevant to ask of data. While the new and exciting prospects of processing data offer humanists a range of exciting possibilities for research, humanistic approaches to the textual and artifactual qualities of data also have a considerable amount to offer to the interpretation of data’</em>.</p>
<p>While the term ‘data’ in the context of the humanities may raise questions due to its semiotic and contextual complexities, it serves as a foundation for understanding both <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data and broader humanities data. The data originating from <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> and the humanities are inherently intertwined, as they often share a similar nature and purpose for scholars. This strong interconnection leads to a collaborative relationship between the <abbr title="Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums">GLAM</abbr> sector and the humanities or <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr>. Scholars in the humanities frequently rely on digitised cultural artefacts, historical records, linguistic resources, and literary works provided by <abbr title="Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums">GLAM</abbr> institutions to gain valuable insights into human history, culture, and traditions. The digitisation efforts and research collaborations between these entities play a pivotal role in preserving <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data and advancing our understanding of diverse societies, fostering a deeper appreciation of our shared human heritage. <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data and humanities data are distinct from other scientific data due to their qualitative and subjective nature, which requires different methods of analysis than quantitative scientific data. They include archival and special collections, rare books, manuscripts, photographs, recordings, artefacts, and other primary sources that reflect the cultural beliefs, identity, and memory of a people (Izu, 2022; see Sabharwal, 2015).</p>
<p>In summary, while <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data and humanities data share some commonalities, they differ in terms of scope and subject matter. <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data focuses specifically on the preservation and documentation of physical artefacts and intangible attributes, while humanities data encompasses a broader range of disciplines within the humanities (Münster et al., 2019). However, it is important to note that the distinction between <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data and humanities data can be blurred, as (meta)data should ideally be co-created and integrated across both domains.</p>
<h4 id="subsec:reprez" tabindex="-1">3.1.2 Representation and Embodiment of Cultural Heritage Data</h4>
<p>Digital representation of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data, while preserving their context and complexity, remain a significant challenge. Those representations, sometimes referred to as digital surrogates or digital twins (Conway, 2015; Semeraro et al., 2021; Shao &amp; Kibira, 2018), of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data can potentially lead to a loss of context and a reduction in the richness of the <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> represented. For instance, a digital image of a cultural artefact may not capture its materiality, such as its texture, weight, and feel, which are essential aspects of the artefact’s cultural significance (Force &amp; Smith, 2021). Furthermore, digital representations may also exclude vital social, cultural, and historical contexts surrounding the object, which is crucial to understanding its full cultural value (Cameron, 2007).</p>
<p>This subsection is structured around two key dimensions. Firstly, it explores materiality, highlighting how digital representations may fail to capture important aspects that are integral to understanding the significance of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> resources. Secondly, it navigates the convergence and divergence between digitised <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> and digital heritage.</p>
<h5 id="subsubsec:materiality" tabindex="-1">3.1.2.1 Materiality</h5>
<p>Briefly, materiality refers to the physical qualities of an object or artefact, such as its colour, texture, and composition. As part of built heritage, the emphasis for materiality relates primarily to architecture, its associated techniques and the range of materials used in the construction or renovation of a building. More specifically, materiality acts as a pivotal factor in the transformation of disparate fragments of material culture into heritage, providing a vital link to the intangible facets of heritage. It contributes significantly to an individual’s social position and ability to navigate specific social milieus, thereby determining their ability to transmit cultural knowledge and values to future generations. The transformative potential of materiality in this regard underscores its fundamental role in perpetuating heritage and the transmission of cultural legacies (Carman, 2009). The physical attributes of objects, including texture, colour and shape, can evoke different emotions and associations, shaping people’s perceptions and memories of these events. Beyond retrospective influences, the potential of materiality extends to the creation of new memories and meanings, as exemplified by the use of materials such as glass in contemporary art. In such cases, materials evoke not only their inherent properties but also symbolic connotations, adding new layers of meaning and memory to the artistic narrative (Fiorentino &amp; Chinni, 2023).</p>
<p>(Edwards &amp; Hart, 2004) [p. 3] argue that materiality is not just concerned with physical objects in a positivist sense, but also involves complex and fluid relationships between people, images, and things. This relationship is influenced by social, cultural, and historical contexts, and plays a crucial role in shaping our perceptions and experiences of the world. Moreover, materiality is central to giving meaning to non-human entities (Haraway, 2003; see Latour, 1996; Star &amp; Griesemer, 1989), which emphasises the role of both humans and non-humans in shaping social and cultural phenomena. For <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data, diversity is at its core, as it allows for the exploration of different ways of knowing, experiencing, and expressing the world. Therefore, it is important to approach materiality not as a static and fixed concept, but as a dynamic and evolving phenomenon that is shaped by multiple forces (Müller, 2018, pp. 62–63). When discussing materiality, there is also its negation, i.e. the notion of space or emptiness, such as how people interact with it through built heritage, which is regarded as a primordial medium of material culture, as expounded by (Guillem et al., 2023) [p. 2]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most intuitive and foundational definition of architecture is the built thing, that is the architecture qua building or built work. Human beings continuously interact with the built materiality through the non-materiality of space. Space as emptiness is formed and defined by the materiality that affects its existence. That relation between fullness and emptiness is what makes possible architecture as lived and experienced space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Materiality also offers a means of challenging dominant narratives and power structures, particularly the Western-centric perspective on <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>. It gives greater recognition to the importance of intangible <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>, which often takes a back seat to tangible objects in dominant narratives (Lenzerini, 2011). By highlighting the materiality of marginalised or forgotten elements, individuals can reclaim their heritage and challenge dominant narratives that marginalise certain groups, contributing to a more inclusive and accurate representation of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>.</p>
<p>The primary focus in terms of digitisation is also on preserving material-based knowledge, often overlooking the dynamic and living nature of intangibility. (Hou et al., 2022) stress the crucial role of computational heritage and information technologies advances in preserving and improving access to intangible <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>. Effectively documenting the ephemeral aspects of intangible heritage and communicating the knowledge that is deeply linked to individuals are pressing challenges. Recent initiatives seek to capture the dynamic facets of cultural practices, using visualisation, augmentation, participation and immersive experiences to enhance experiential narratives. There is a strong call for a strategic re-evaluation of the intangible <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> digitisation process, emphasising the human body as a vessel for traditions and memories, such as capturing traditional Southern Chinese martial arts, who has been passed down colloquially from generations and needs a methodological approach to capture such embodied knowledge (see Adamou et al., 2023; Hou &amp; Kenderdine, 2024).</p>
<p>Even in cases where considerable efforts have been devoted to digitisation of physical objects such as medieval manuscripts and rare books over the past few decades (Nielsen, 2008), a lingering concern persists regarding the authentic encounter with the original artefact, despite its enhanced accessibility through digital surrogates (Lit, 2020). Material attributes present a persistent challenge to achieving full replication. Despite advances facilitated by techniques such as <abbr title="Reflectance Transformation Imaging">RTI</abbr>, <abbr title="three-dimensional">3D</abbr> digitisation, or <abbr title="virtual reality">VR</abbr> and <abbr title="Augmented reality">AR</abbr>, which offer better experiential immersion and are more effective than two-dimensional representations in addressing certain materiality concerns, the ability to replicate the multifaceted sensory experience associated with the original object, including the palpable emotions and spatial sensation, remains an ongoing endeavour, presenting a complex and multifaceted dimension of a challenge that is quite unlikely and may never be fully feasible (see Endres, 2019).</p>
<h5 id="subsubsec:digitised_digital_heritage" tabindex="-1">3.1.2.2 Digitised Cultural Heritage and Digital Heritage</h5>
<p>The concepts of digitised <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> and digital heritage intersect through the use of digital technology for the preservation, access, and dissemination of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> resources. Digitised <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> focuses on converting physical artefacts into digital forms, ensuring their long-term preservation and accessibility through digital means. Conversely, digital heritage includes a broader range of digital tools and resources <em>‘to preserve, research and communicate cultural heritage’</em> ((Münster et al., 2021) p. 2, citing (Georgopoulos, 2018)).</p>
<p>Digitised <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> acts as a critical bridge, facilitating a transition from traditional or analogue <abbr title="Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums">GLAM</abbr> practices to a digital environment. This shift is pivotal in unlocking the potential of digitised <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>. These values extend beyond scholarly pursuits, despite the majority of digitisation efforts being driven by research funding. In doing so, it becomes evident that the creative reuse and data-driven innovation stemming from digitised <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> necessitate substantial and sustained investment in the <abbr title="Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums">GLAM</abbr> sector. This investment is fundamental, especially amidst reduced funding due to years of austerity. (Terras et al., 2021) underscore this need, shedding light on the delicate balance required with commercial outcomes. They emphasised that leveraging <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> datasets offers vast opportunities for technological innovation and economic benefits, urging professionals from various domains to collaborate and experiment in a low-risk environment.</p>
<p>Digital heritage<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">[21]</a></sup> encompasses a wide range of human knowledge and expression in cultural, educational, scientific and various other domains. In today’s rapidly evolving technological landscape, an increasing amount of this knowledge is either digitally created or in the process of being converted from analogue to digital formats (He et al., 2017). These digital resources cover a wide range, including text, multimedia, software and more, and require deliberate and strategic management to ensure their long-term preservation. This valuable heritage, spread across the globe and expressed in multiple languages (UNESCO, 2009).</p>
<p>In summary, digitised <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> not only forges the path to digital heritage but also embodies an ever-evolving cultural landscape. Recognising the transformative potency with digital heritage is essential to enriching our understanding and engagement with our cultural roots. Both concepts are intimately embedded in <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> and play a vital role as conduits.</p>
<h4 id="subsec:collective-apparatus" tabindex="-1">3.1.3 Collectives and Apparatuses</h4>
<p>The collaborative efforts of collectives and the operation of various apparatuses play a fundamental part in shaping the preservation, interpretation and dissemination of cultural artefacts and practices. This subsection is concerned with the central contributions of human and non-human actors engaged in cooperative action and the <em>modus operandi</em> of various apparatuses, such as building (digital) infrastructures. Some of these considerations are drawn from <abbr title="Science and Technology Studies">STS</abbr>, which are more fully captured in , serving as the theoretical framework for the thesis.</p>
<p>Bruno Latour’s concept of the importance of collectives and apparatuses (see Latour, 2022, p. 15) can be extrapolated to <abbr title="Cultural Heritage Institution">CHI</abbr>s. Every institution’s or project’s ultimate success hinges on the collaboration and support of individuals, as well as the tools, systems and technologies they use. Indeed, paralleling <abbr title="Cultural Heritage Institution">CHI</abbr>s with wider contexts suggests that collective efforts and apparatuses play a critical role in shaping the effectiveness of any institution. This highlights the importance of recognising the influence of both human and non-human entities in institutional functioning and underlines the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics involved therein.</p>
<p><abbr title="Actor-Network Theory">ANT</abbr> can be a useful lens to analyse the creation, use, and dissemination of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data. <abbr title="Actor-Network Theory">ANT</abbr> posits that actors are not independent entities but are instead part of a network that consists of both human and non-human entities. According to <abbr title="Actor-Network Theory">ANT</abbr>, every actor, be it a person or a technology, is a node in the network and contributes to the overall functioning of the network (Callon, 2001; Latour, 2005). When we apply this framework to <abbr title="Cultural Heritage Institution">CHI</abbr>s, we can identify the different actors involved in the creation, use, and dissemination of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data. These actors can include individuals, such as curators, conservators, and historians, as well as non-human entities, such as databases, digitisation equipment, and software. Moreover, this approach can help us understand the interactions between these actors and how they shape the overall functioning of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage Institution">CHI</abbr>s. For instance, digitisation equipment can enable the creation of high-quality digital images of artefacts, which can then be disseminated globally through online platforms. Examining the Notre-Dame de Paris, one can discern the keystones at the summit of its arches as indispensable actors within its architectural narrative. These keystones, imbued with historical narratives and a non-human facet, played a central role in the (digital) rescue and subsequent restoration efforts following the tragic roof fire in April 2019. (Guillem et al., 2023)’s study further elucidates this restoration journey, emphasising how the keystones, with their individual narratives and structural significance, contributed to the (digital) reassembly.</p>
<p>Building on this perspective, we can explore the importance of community involvement in the preservation and management of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data, thereby increasing the potential for sustainable practices and inclusive engagement.</p>
<p>Local communities have an integral part to play in the management and preservation <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data, especially in the digital age where resources are often scarce for <abbr title="Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums">GLAM</abbr> institutions. Community involvement has several benefits, including increased engagement and participation, access to local knowledge and expertise, and more sustainable and inclusive management and preservation practices (Ridge et al., 2021). For instance, geophysical technologies such as ground-penetrating radar have been used with great success in identifying and evaluating the depth, extent, and composition of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> resources for research and management purposes, easing tensions when working with sensitive ancestral places (Nelson, 2021). Collaborative environments can also help with <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> information sharing and communication tasks because of the way in which they provide a visual context to users, making it easier to find and relate <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> content (Respaldiza Hidalgo et al., 2011).</p>
<p>Embarking on (Brown et al., 2023) [pp. 6-7]'s insightful analysis, a prominent illustration of exemplary community practice can be found in the sphere of community museums in Latin America: <em>Inicio - Museos Comunitarios de América</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">[22]</a></sup>. The author highlights the role of community engagement and leadership in the creation and operation of these museums. Such engagement ensures that these museums are not imposed from outside, but rather emerge organically as museums the community, resonating with its unique <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> and identity. This approach is consistent with the ethos of <em>‘telling a story’</em>, building a future, which embodies a deep commitment to community empowerment and cultural preservation. This community-centric approach amplifies the museum’s resonance with the community’s lived experiences and historical narratives.</p>
<p>At the same time, institutions can also benefit from collaborating with peer communities like <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> to promote greater access to their collections. <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> provides a set of open standards for delivering high-quality digital objects online at scale, which can help memory and academic institutions share their collections with each other and with the wider public (Snydman et al., 2015; Weinthal &amp; Childress, 2019). By adopting <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> standards, organisations can make their collections more discoverable and accessible to researchers, developers, and other <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> professionals (Padfield et al., 2022). Involvement in communities such as <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> also helps to mitigate costs as they develop shared or adaptable resources and services (Raemy, 2017).</p>
<p>Participation of communities in the management and preservation of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> resources is essential to ensure that <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> is protected and accessible for future generations. By involving and participating in communities, <abbr title="Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums">GLAM</abbr>s can tap into local as well as peer knowledge and expertise, making management and preservation practices more sustainable and inclusive. This approach also increases engagement and participation, ensuring that <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> is valued and appreciated by the wider community. Thus, memory institutions need to collaborate closely with communities to ensure that <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data, and their underlying infrastructures and services, is being effectively curated (Delmas-Glass &amp; Sanderson, 2020).</p>
<p>Closely related to this context, (Star, 1999) points out the often unacknowledged role of infrastructure within society. She argues that infrastructures are necessary but often invisible and taken for granted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People commonly envision infrastructure as a system of substrates – railroad, lines, pipes and plumbing, electrical power plants, and wires. It is by definition invisible, part of the background for other kinds of work. It is ready-to-hand. This image holds up well enough for many purposes – turn on the faucet for a drink of water and you use a vast infrastructure of plumbing and water regulation without usually thinking much about it. [(Star, 1999) p. 380]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Star, 1999) [pp. 381-382, citing (Star &amp; Ruhleder, 1994)] identifies nine dimensions to define infrastructure. They provide a comprehensive framework to comprehend the nuanced nature of infrastructure and its pervasive impact on diverse societal facets. The following dimensions are vital for analysing the often imperceptible, yet deeply embedded structures that constitute the foundational framework of both daily life and broader societal operations<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">[23]</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Embeddedness</strong>:   Infrastructure is sunk into and inside of other structures, social     arrangements, and technologies. People do not necessarily     distinguish the several coordinated aspects of infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong>:   Infrastructure is transparent to use, in the sense that it does not     have to be reinvented each time or assembled for each task, but     invisibly supports those tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Reach or scope</strong>:   This may be either spatial or temporal – infrastructure has reach     beyond a single event or one-site practice.</li>
<li><strong>Learned as part of membership</strong>:   Strangers and outsiders encounter infrastructure as a target object     to be learned about. New participants acquire a naturalised     familiarity with its objects, as they become members.</li>
<li><strong>Links with conventions of practice</strong>:   Infrastructure both shapes and is shaped by the conventions of a     community of practice.</li>
<li><strong>Embodiment of standards</strong>:   Modified by scope and often by conflicting conventions,     infrastructure takes on transparency by plugging into other     infrastructures and tools in a standardised fashion.</li>
<li><strong>Built on an installed base</strong>:   Infrastructure does not grow <em>de novo</em>; it wrestles with the inertia     of the installed based and inherits strengths and limitations from     that base.</li>
<li><strong>Becomes visible upon breakdown</strong>:   The normally invisible quality of working infrastructure becomes     visible when it breaks: the server is down, the bridge washes out,     there is a power blackout.</li>
<li><strong>Is fixed in modular increments, not all at once or globally</strong>:   Because infrastructure is big, layered, and complex, and because it     means different things locally, it is never changed from above.     Changes take time and negotiations, and adjustment with other     aspects of the systems are involved.</li>
</ul>
<p>An appreciation of these dimensions is crucial to the analysis of the network of infrastructural systems that underpin contemporary society, and is necessary for the analysis of any digital infrastructure that manages <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data.</p>
<p>Digital infrastructures – also known as e-infrastructures or cyberinfrastructures – are forms of infrastructure that are essential for the functioning of today’s society (see Jackson et al., 2007; Ribes &amp; Lee, 2010). These kinds of infrastructure need to be understood as socio-technical systems, showcasing the interplay between technological components (such as hardware, software, and networks) and the social and organisational contexts in which they operate (Star &amp; Ruhleder, 1994). According to (Fresa, 2013) [p. 33], digital <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> infrastructures should be able to serve the research needs of humanities scholars as well as having dedicated services for education, learning, and general public access. In terms of requirements, (Fresa, 2013) [pp. 36-39] identifies three different layers of services: for content providers, for managing and adding value to the content, and for the research communities. For the latter, several sub-services tailored to research communities are listed. These encompass long-term preservation, <abbr title="Persistent Identifier">PID</abbr>s<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">[24]</a></sup>, interoperability and aggregation, advanced search, data resource set-up, user authentication and access control, as well as rights management.</p>
<p>Overall, (digital) infrastructures are imperative apparatuses in preserving and sharing <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data. First, they support preservation by archiving digital artefacts and their metadata, protecting them from deterioration and loss. Secondly, these infrastructures facilitate accessibility, allowing a global audience to explore and appreciate cultural heritage online. Finally, they encourage interpretation and engagement, promoting cross-cultural understanding and knowledge sharing.</p>
<p>Moreover, infrastructure is a fundamental component that demands extensive investment, particularly in the creation of streamlined integration layers capable of interacting seamlessly with different systems. This can be exemplified by such institutions as the Rijksmuseum<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">[25]</a></sup> , where a well-constructed infrastructure allows for efficient integration and interaction with various technological and organisational systems (Dijkshoorn, 2023). This investment serves as the foundation for an institution’s functionality, allowing for the smooth flow of data, the coordination of processes and the optimal use of resources. In a similar vein, (Canning et al., 2022) argue that the often invisible structures of metadata, particularly in Linked Data ontologies, play a crucial role in shaping the interpretation of data. These structures, while not immediately apparent, are imbued with value judgements and ideological implications, extending the impact of metadata beyond mere technicalities to encompass diverse and inter-sectional perspectives. This multidimensional ontological approach addresses the complexity and diversity of data sources, paralleling the need for sophisticated infrastructures in institutions like the Rijksmuseum. It underscores the importance of integrating inter-sectional feminist principles in information systems, reflecting a commitment to diverse ways of knowing and nuanced storytelling.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as all (meta)data requires storage, it raises an important concern in terms of the entrenched power dynamics governing knowledge representation within information systems, as pointed out by  This perspective, initially centred around museum objects, holds broader implications for all <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> resources (see Simandiraki-Grimshaw, 2023). Canning strongly advocates for the essential adaptation of databases to embrace a diverse array of epistemological approaches by introducing new types of affordances. Databases, despite their role in information preservation, wield significant influence that can inadvertently stifle diverse modes of knowledge interpretation and <em>‘can constrain ways of knowing’</em>. Furthermore, she compellingly argues that modifications to databases extend beyond technical adjustments; they are inextricably linked to shifts in institutional power dynamics and the enduring, often inequitable, power dynamics governing the world of museums – <em>or any <abbr title="Cultural Heritage Institution">CHI</abbr>s</em> – and their curation.</p>
<p>In understanding the interplay of collectives and apparatuses, it is clear that key actors, including individuals, institutions, local and global communities, as well as the sophisticated fabric of (digital) infrastructures and their components, are deeply entangled and interconnected. These entities, both human and non-human, collectively shape and navigate the rich networks of human interactions and technologies that underpin the foundations of contemporary society.</p>
<h3 id="sec:metadata" tabindex="-1">3.2 Cultural Heritage Metadata</h3>
<p>This subsection offers insights into the importance of metadata in <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>, underlining its role in enhancing the understanding and accessibility of cultural artefacts. It is structured into <s>three</s> <strong>four</strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">[26]</a></sup> essential parts. I start with an introductory segment in <a href="#subsec:metadata-introduction">3.2.1</a>, then I explore the types and functions of metadata in <a href="#subsec:types-functions">3.2.2</a>, thirdly in <a href="#subsec:metadata-standards">3.2.3</a>, I outline some of the most important <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> metadata standards, and finally in <a href="#subsec:kos">3.2.4</a>, I explore the use of <abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr>, such as generic classification systems and controlled vocabularies.</p>
<h4 id="subsec:metadata-introduction" tabindex="-1">3.2.1 Data about Data</h4>
<p>For curating <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> resources, metadata<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">[27]</a></sup>, ‘data about data’, is probably one of the key concept that needs to be introduced here. Metadata permeate our digital and physical landscapes, playing a vital role in organising, describing and managing a vast array of information. Rather than being confined to a specific domain, they are ubiquitous and pervade many aspects of our everyday lives (Riley, 2017, pp. 2–3). From websites and databases to social media platforms and online marketplaces, metadata adds meaning to data, enabling users to understand their context, relevance and provenance. As an example, <a href="#fig:meta-metadata">Figure 3.1</a> shows the metadata of a book<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">[28]</a></sup>.</p>
<figure id="fig:meta-metadata" style="margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">

</figure>
<p>Metadata are central to the management and preservation of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data, providing essential information to ensure that data can be properly organised, discovered and retrieved. For example, they facilitate the understanding and interpretation of data, enabling scholars and the public to access and use them effectively (Constantopoulos &amp; Dallas, 2008). Metadata also help to ensure the long-term preservation and accessibility of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data [(Zeng &amp; Qin, 2022) pp. 490-491]. Providing metadata in a structured manner facilitates forms of aggregation, i.e. individuals and institutions being able to harvest and organise metadata from multiple sources or repositories into a centralised location (see Freire et al., 2017, 2021). In addition, the importance of metadata as a gateway to information is particularly compelling when the primary embodiment of a record is either unavailable or lost. In cases where resources, time constraints, sensitive content or strategic decisions prevent the digitisation of an item, metadata becomes the principal means of representation and access. If a physical record is lost or damaged, the metadata associated with that record acts as a proxy for the record.</p>
<p>(Riley, 2017) [p. 5] discusses the transformation of libraries over time. Initially, libraries moved from search terminals to the modern web-based resource discovery systems we use today. This shift was driven by advances in computerisation. Libraries’ basic approach to metadata is ‘bibliographic’, deeply rooted in their traditional expertise in describing books. This approach involves providing detailed descriptions of individual items so that users can easily locate them within the library’s collection.</p>
<p>On the other hand, archives use ‘finding aids’, which are descriptive inventories of their collections, coupled with historical context. These aids are essential for users to understand the material and to find groups of related items within the archive. The metadata used in archives allows for the contextualisation of materials, particularly papers of individuals or records of organisations, providing a richer understanding of the content.</p>
<p>Similarly, museums actively manage and track their acquisitions, exhibitions and loans through metadata. Museum curators use metadata to interpret collections for visitors, explaining the historical and social significance of artefacts and describing the relationships and connections between different objects. This helps to enhance the overall visitor experience and understanding of the artefacts on display or the digital resources on a particular website.</p>
<h4 id="subsec:types-functions" tabindex="-1">3.2.2 Types and Functions</h4>
<p><abbr title="Cultural Heritage Institution">CHI</abbr>s share common objectives and concerns related to information management, as highlighted by (Lim &amp; Li Liew, 2011) [pp. 484-485]. These goals typically include facilitating access to knowledge and ensuring the integrity of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data. However, it is important to note that <abbr title="Cultural Heritage Institution">CHI</abbr>s also differ widely in how they deal with metadata. Different domains have unique approaches and standards for describing the materials they collect, preserve and disseminate, and even within a single domain there are significant differences.</p>
<p>There have been different attempts to categorise the metadata landscape. For instance, (Gilliland, 2016) identified the following five categories of metadata and their respective functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Administrative</strong>:   Metadata used in managing and administering collections and     information resources, such as acquisition and appraisal information     or documentation related to repatriation.</li>
<li><strong>Descriptive</strong>:   Metadata used to identify, authenticate, and describe collections     and related trusted information resources. Finding aids, cataloguing     records, annotations by practitioners and end users, as well as     metadata generated by or through a given <abbr title="Digital asset management">DAM</abbr> system can often be classified as     descriptive metadata.</li>
<li><strong>Preservation</strong>:   Metadata related to the preservation management of collections and     information resources. Common examples of preservation metadata are     documentation of physical condition of resources or of any actions     taken to preserve resources, whether physical restoration or data     migration.</li>
<li><strong>Technical</strong>:   Metadata related to how a system functions or metadata behaves.     Examples include software documentation and digitisation     information.</li>
<li><strong>Use</strong>:   Metadata related to the level and type of use of collections and     information resources, such as circulation records, search logs, or     rights metadata.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile (Riley, 2009), as illustrated in a comprehensive visualisation graph<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">[29]</a></sup>, suggested seven functions, i.e. the role a standard play in the creation and storage and metadata, and seven purposes referring to the general type of metadata.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Functions</strong>:   Conceptual Model, Content Standard, Controlled Vocabulary,     Framework/Technology, Markup Language, Record Format, and Structure     Standard.</li>
<li><strong>Purposes</strong>:   Data, Descriptive Metadata, Metadata Wrappers, Preservation     Metadata, Rights Metadata, Structural Metadata, and Technical     Metadata.</li>
</ul>
<p>Almost a decade later, (Riley, 2017) [pp. 6-7] summarised metadata types into four groupings instead of the seven purposes previously mentioned. is removed from the list and technical, preservation and rights metadata are now grouped into a newly created administrative metadata category.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Descriptive metadata</strong>: For finding or understanding a resource</li>
<li><strong>Administrative metadata</strong>: Umbrella term referring to the information needed to manage a resource or that relates to its creation
<ul>
<li><strong>2.1 Technical metadata</strong>: For decoding and rendering files</li>
<li><strong>2.2 Preservation metadata</strong>: Long-term management of files</li>
<li><strong>2.3 Rights metadata</strong>: Intellectual property rights attached to content</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Structural metadata</strong>: Relationships of parts of resources to one another</li>
<li><strong>Markup Language</strong>: Integrates metadata and flags for other structural or semantic features within content<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">[30]</a></sup>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This classification of metadata types and function differs to the categories identified by (Gilliland, 2016) mostly due to the addition of structural metadata and markup language as their own categories [(Zeng &amp; Qin, 2022) p. 19]. <a href="#tab:riley-metadata-types">Table 3.1</a> lists the major types of metadata according to (Riley, 2017) [p 7] and include example properties and their primary uses.</p>

<p>Ultimately, metadata can also be leveraged to create more inclusive and diverse representations of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>. For instance, metadata can be used to document and promote underrepresented communities and their heritage, providing greater visibility and recognition. This approach aligns with the principles of decolonising <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>, promoting equity and social justice by recognising and valuing diverse cultural perspectives, especially in the prevailing anglophone and Western-centric standpoint in <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> (Mahony, 2018; Philip, 2021).</p>
<p>Moreover, the distinction between data and metadata, as discussed in the work of (Alter et al., 2023), is not always distinct, leading to the concept of <em>‘semantic transposition’</em>. This complexity reflects in <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> where what is considered metadata in one context might be primary data in another, underscoring the necessity for adaptable frameworks in data management. This understanding is crucial for fostering inclusive and diverse representations in <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>, ensuring that all cultural narratives are appropriately documented and acknowledged.</p>
<h4 id="subsec:metadata-standards" tabindex="-1">3.2.3 Standards</h4>
<p>Metadata standards play a crucial role in ensuring that data are organised and consistent, facilitating mutual understanding between different stakeholders (Raemy, 2020). <abbr title="Cultural Heritage Institution">CHI</abbr>s such as <abbr title="Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums">GLAM</abbr>s typically follow established conventions or standards when organising their resources. Current methods of cataloguing have historical roots dating back to the century, particularly with the development of cataloguing systems such as Antonio Panizzi’s at the British Museum and Charles Coffin Jewett’s efforts to mechanically duplicate entries at the library of the Smithsonian Institution [(Zeng &amp; Qin, 2022) pp. 14-15].</p>
<p>Unique metadata standards, rules and models have been established and maintained within specific sub-fields. In addition, certain standards for information resources have been endorsed by authoritative bodies (Greenberg, 2005), and some are used exclusively within specific domain communities (Hillmann et al., 2008). (Riley, 2017) [p. 5] underscores the predilection of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> metadata – whether these standards emanate from libraries, archives, or museums – toward accentuating descriptive attributes. The foundational <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> metadata standards, primarily conceived to [(Zeng &amp; Qin, 2022) p. 11], manifest this thematic focus. Within the <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> domain, metadata standards vary widely in scope, and a number of different standards have been developed to meet different needs and priorities<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">[31]</a></sup> (Freire et al., 2018).</p>
<p>The following quoted passage sheds some light on the different approaches and levels of collaboration in metadata standardisation, namely among the library and museum sectors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite the striving for homogeneity, in practice, the production of metadata among  information  specialists  and  the  use  of  metadata  standards  is  already  marked by considerable diversity. This has come about for very pragmatic reasons. Different types of objects and collections require different types of metadata. The curatorial interest for particular information differs for example between images held  in  an  art  gallery  and  a  library,  as  does  the  information  specialists’ domain  expertise. Accordingly,  diversity  in  metadata  practice  seems  to  be  greatest  in  museums  as  they  are  the  institutions  that  govern  the  most  diverse  collections.  While the library sector has <em>‘systematically and cooperatively created and shared’</em> metadata standards since the 1960s, the museum sector, mostly handling images and objects, has been slower to establish such collaboration and consensus. (Dahlgren &amp; Hansson, 2020, p. 244)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this context, I want to focus on some metadata standards that have proved vital across libraries, archives, museums and galleries. These standards, which I will briefly describe, serve as the foundation for organising, describing, and enabling efficient access to vast and diverse collections. Of particular interest I will be taking a closer look at <abbr title="CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model">CIDOC-CRM</abbr> as it serves as the cornerstone of Linked Art, a fundamental <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> standard.</p>
<h5 id="subsubsec:library-metadata" tabindex="-1">3.2.3.1 Library Metadata Standards</h5>
<p>In libraries, several metadata standards have played crucial roles in organising and accessing collections over the years. The most prevalent historical standard, <abbr title="Machine-Readable Cataloging">MARC</abbr><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">[32]</a></sup>, was a pilot project from the 1960s funded by the <abbr title="Council on Library and Information Resources">CLIR</abbr> and led by the <abbr title="Library of Congress">LoC</abbr> to structure cataloguing data and distribute them through magnetic tapes (Avram, 1968, p. 3). The standard evolved into <abbr title="Machine-Readable Cataloging">MARC</abbr>21 in 1999 [(Zeng &amp; Qin, 2022) p. 418] – as exemplified by <a href="#lst:marc21">Code Snippet 3.1</a>, providing a structured format for bibliographic records and related information in machine-readable form. It uses codes, fields, and sub-fields to structure data. Another significant historical standard is the <abbr title="Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules">AACR</abbr>, published in 1967 and revised in 1978 that provides sets of rules for descriptive cataloguing of various types of information resources.</p>

<p><abbr title="Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules">AACR</abbr> is no longer maintained and was replaced by <abbr title="Resource Description and Access">RDA</abbr><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">[33]</a></sup> around 2010 to be a more adaptive standard to contemporary needs. <abbr title="Resource Description and Access">RDA</abbr>, while not a markup language like <abbr title="Machine-Readable Cataloging">MARC</abbr>, serves as a content standard that guides the description and discovery of resources, focusing on user needs and facilitating improved navigation of library collections. Its goal is to provide a flexible and extensible framework for the description of all types of resources, ensuring discoverability, accessibility, and relevance for users<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">[34]</a></sup> (Sprochi, 2016, p. 130).</p>
<p>Libraries often leverage other standards to enrich their metadata practices. <abbr title="Metadata Object Description Schema">MODS</abbr><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">[35]</a></sup>, introduced in 2002, offers a more flexible <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>-based schema for bibliographic description, allowing for better integration with other standards and systems. It was initially developed to carry [(Zeng &amp; Qin, 2022) p. 423]. <abbr title="Metadata Object Description Schema">MODS</abbr> provides a balance between human readability and machine processing, making it suitable for a wide range of resources and use cases (Guenther, 2003, p. 139). <abbr title="Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard">METS</abbr><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">[36]</a></sup>, on the other hand, is a standard for encoding descriptive, administrative, and structural metadata regarding objects within a digital library. <abbr title="Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard">METS</abbr>, developed as an initiative of the <abbr title="Digital Library Federation">DLF</abbr>, provides a flexible and extensible framework for structuring metadata, allowing for the packaging of complex digital objects (Cantara, 2005, pp. 238–239). While <abbr title="Metadata Object Description Schema">MODS</abbr> is primarily concerned with bibliographic information, <abbr title="Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard">METS</abbr> focuses on structuring metadata for digital objects, making it particularly useful for digital libraries and repositories.</p>
<p>A further important standard is <abbr title="Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records">FRBR</abbr>, a conceptual framework for understanding and structuring bibliographic data and access points. Originally developed by <abbr title="International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions">IFLA</abbr> in 1997 as part of its functional requirements family of models, <abbr title="Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records">FRBR</abbr> describes three main groups of entities, relationships, and attributes as illustrated by <a href="#fig:frbr">Figure 3.2</a>. The first group of entities are the foundation of the model which characterises four levels of abstraction: <abbr title="Work, Expression, Manifestation, Item">WEMI</abbr> (Denton, 2006, p. 231). <abbr title="Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records">FRBR</abbr> has had a significant impact on the development of <abbr title="Resource Description and Access">RDA</abbr>, which is loosely aligned with the principles and structures defined by the conceptual framework, but as it isn’t a data model <em>per se</em>; it does not inform how to record bibliographic information in day-to-day practice and focus heavily on textual resources<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37">[37]</a></sup> (Sprochi, 2016, pp. 130–131). Furthermore, (Cossham, 2017) [p. 11] asserts that <abbr title="Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records">FRBR</abbr> and <abbr title="Resource Description and Access">RDA</abbr>, <em>‘don’t align well with the ways that users use, understand, and experience library catalogues nor with the ways that they understand and experience the wider information environment’</em>.</p>

<p>A further important standard in the field of library science is the <abbr title="IFLA Library Reference Model">LRM</abbr>, which was introduced as a comprehensive conceptual framework. It provides a broad understanding of bibliographic data and user-centric design principles, aligning with <abbr title="Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records">FRBR</abbr>. <abbr title="IFLA Library Reference Model">LRM</abbr> defines key entities, attributes, and relationships important for bibliographic searches, interpretation, and navigation – as shown in <a href="#fig:lrm-relationships">Figure 3.3</a>. It operates at the conceptual level and does not dictate data storage methods. Attributes in <abbr title="IFLA Library Reference Model">LRM</abbr> can be represented as literals or <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s. The model is presented in a structured document format to support <abbr title="Linked Open Data">LOD</abbr> applications and reduce ambiguity. During its development, a parallel process created <abbr title="Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records">FRBR</abbr>oo (see <a href="#subsubsec:museums-metadata">3.2.3.3</a>), a model that extends the original <abbr title="Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records">FRBR</abbr> model by incorporating it into <abbr title="CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model">CIDOC-CRM</abbr>. <abbr title="Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records">FRBR</abbr>oo focuses on <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data and is more detailed than <abbr title="IFLA Library Reference Model">LRM</abbr>, which is designed specifically for library data and follows a high-level, user-centric approach (Riva et al., 2017, pp. 9–13). The <abbr title="IFLA Library Reference Model">LRM</abbr> model, known as <abbr title="IFLA Library Reference Model">LRM</abbr>er<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38">[38]</a></sup>, was released in 2020 by <abbr title="International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions">IFLA</abbr> [(Zeng &amp; Qin, 2022) p. 163].</p>

<p><abbr title="Bibliographic Framework">BibFrame</abbr><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39">[39]</a></sup> is another metadata standard in the library domain. It was initiated around 2011 by the <abbr title="Library of Congress">LoC</abbr> to be a successor of <abbr title="Machine-Readable Cataloging">MARC</abbr>, which had become obsolete (see Tennant, 2002) as well as being invisible to web crawlers and search engines preventing adequate discoverability of bibliographic resources (Sprochi, 2016, p. 132). <abbr title="Bibliographic Framework">BibFrame</abbr> is a loosely <abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr>-based model (Sanderson, 2015), intending to improve the interoperability and discoverability of library resources. While the <abbr title="Bibliographic Framework">BibFrame</abbr> model may not perfectly correspond with the <abbr title="Work, Expression, Manifestation, Item">WEMI</abbr> entities outlined in <abbr title="Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records">FRBR</abbr>, it is possible to effectively link <abbr title="Bibliographic Framework">BibFrame</abbr> resources to <abbr title="Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records">FRBR</abbr> entities, ensuring their compatibility (Sprochi, 2016, p. 133). <abbr title="Bibliographic Framework">BibFrame</abbr> aims to transition from <abbr title="Machine-Readable Cataloging">MARC</abbr> by providing a more web-friendly framework, focusing on the relationships between entities, improving data sharing, and accommodating the digital environment. Conversely, (Edmunds, 2023) argues that <abbr title="Bibliographic Framework">BibFrame</abbr> is unaffordable and leads to elitism within libraries, with the main beneficiaries being well-funded institutions, particularly in North America, while placing a financial burden on others. This approach, endorsed by bodies such as the <abbr title="Library of Congress">LoC</abbr>, is criticised for its high cost, impracticality, inequity and limited benefits for cataloguers, libraries, vendors and the public they serve. In addition, the author highlights <abbr title="Bibliographic Framework">BibFrame</abbr>'s lack of user friendliness, regardless of the intended users, and criticises the notion of adopting Linked Data for its own sake without substantial practical benefits.</p>
<h5 id="subsubsec:archives-metadata" tabindex="-1">3.2.3.2 Archival Metadata Standards</h5>
<p>For archives, metadata standards like <abbr title="Encoded Archival Description">EAD</abbr><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40">[40]</a></sup> and <abbr title="General International Standard Archival Description">ISAD(G)</abbr><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41">[41]</a></sup> have been pivotal. <abbr title="Encoded Archival Description">EAD</abbr>, introduced in the mid-1990s – it originated in 1993 and the first version of <abbr title="Encoded Archival Description">EAD</abbr> was released in 1998, provides a hierarchical structure for representing information about archival collections, offering comprehensive descriptions that aid researchers, archivists, and institutions in managing and providing access to archival records. Its goal is to create a standard for encoding finding aids to improve accessibility and understanding of archival collections (Pitti, 1999, pp. 61–62). On the other hand, <abbr title="General International Standard Archival Description">ISAD(G)</abbr>, released in its first version in 1994 by <abbr title="International Council on Archives">ICA</abbr>, offers a more general international standard for archival description, providing a framework for describing all types of archival materials, including fonds, sub-fonds, series, files, and items (Shepherd &amp; Smith, 2000, p. 57). <abbr title="General International Standard Archival Description">ISAD(G)</abbr> aims to establish consistent and standardised archival description practices on a global scale, facilitating the sharing and exchange of archival information.</p>
<p><abbr title="PREservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies">PREMIS</abbr><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42">[42]</a></sup>, is another metadata standard that was initially released in 2005 – version 3.0 is the latest specification, published in 2016 – and focuses on the preservation of digital objects, consisting of four interrelated entities: <code>Object</code>, <code>Event</code>, <code>Agent</code>, and <code>Rights</code> (Caplan &amp; Guenther, 2005, p. 111). The main objective of <abbr title="PREservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies">PREMIS</abbr> is to help institutions ensure the long-term accessibility of data by capturing key details about their creation, format, provenance, and preservation events. It is seen as an elaboration of <abbr title="Open Archival Information System">OAIS</abbr>, which categorises information required for preservation in several functional entities and types of information package (see Lee, 2009, pp. 425–426) – as illustrated by <a href="#fig:oais">Figure 3.4</a>, expressed through the mapping of preservation metadata onto the conceptual model [(Zeng &amp; Qin, 2022) pp. 493-494].</p>

<p>The latest development in metadata standards for archives is the creation of <abbr title="Records in Context">RiC</abbr>, which has been developed since 2012 by <abbr title="International Council on Archives">ICA</abbr> (Clavaud &amp; Wildi, 2021, pp. 79–80). <abbr title="Records in Context">RiC</abbr> is structured into four complementary parts (ICA Expert Group on Archival Description, 2023, p. 1) intended to cover and replace existing archival standards such as <abbr title="General International Standard Archival Description">ISAD(G)</abbr>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><abbr title="Records in Context">RiC</abbr> Foundations of Archival Description</strong>:   A brief description of the foundational principles and purposes of     archival description.</li>
<li><strong><abbr title="Records in Context">RiC</abbr> Conceptual Model</strong>:   A high-level framework for archival description<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43">[43]</a></sup>, as shown in <a href="#fig:ric-cm">Figure 3.5</a>.</li>
<li><strong><abbr title="Records in Context">RiC</abbr>-O</strong>:   The ontology<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44">[44]</a></sup>, which embodies a specific implementation of the     conceptual model. It is formally expressed in     <abbr title="Web Ontology Language">OWL</abbr> to make     archival description available using <abbr title="Linked Open Data">LOD</abbr> techniques – which facilitating     extensions (see Mikhaylova &amp; Metilli, 2023) – and adheres to a     conceptual vocabulary specific to archival description. It provides     the ability to navigate and interpret complex archival holdings and     foster meaningful research and discovery. The ontology includes     seven main groups of entities: <code>Record</code>, <code>Agent</code>, <code>Rule</code>, <code>Event</code>,     <code>Date</code>, <code>Place</code>, and <code>Instantiation</code>.</li>
<li><strong><abbr title="Records in Context">RiC</abbr> Application Guidelines</strong>:   A part in development at the time of writing which will provide     practitioners and software developers with guidance and examples for     implementing the conceptual model and the ontology in records and     archival management systems.</li>

<h5 id="subsubsec:museums-metadata" tabindex="-1">3.2.3.3 Museum and Gallery Metadata Standards</h5>
<p>In the museum and gallery domain, various metadata standards and conceptual models have significantly contributed to the management, organisation, and accessibility of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> objects and artworks. Notable among these are <abbr title="Categories for the Description of Works of Art">CDWA</abbr>, <abbr title="Cataloging Cultural Objects">CCO</abbr>, <abbr title="Lightweight Information Describing Objects">LIDO</abbr>, <abbr title="CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model">CIDOC-CRM</abbr>, as well as Linked Art.</p>
<p><abbr title="Categories for the Description of Works of Art">CDWA</abbr><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45">[45]</a></sup>, developed in the mid-1990s and maintained by the Getty Vocabulary Program, and <abbr title="Cataloging Cultural Objects">CCO</abbr><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46">[46]</a></sup> created by the <abbr title="Visual Resource Association">VRA</abbr><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47">[47]</a></sup>, introduced in the early 2000s, primarily focus on describing art and cultural artefacts, providing a framework for recording essential details like artist, title, medium, date, and provenance. <abbr title="Categories for the Description of Works of Art">CDWA</abbr> is a comprehensive set of guidelines for cataloguing and describing various cultural objects, including artworks, architectural elements, material culture items, collections of works, and associated images. While not a data model itself, it offers a conceptual framework for designing data models and databases, as well as for information retrieval. It then evolved into <abbr title="Categories for the Description of Works of Art">CDWA</abbr> Lite, an <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> schema for data harvesting purposes (Baca &amp; Harpring, 2017, pp. 1–2).</p>
<p><abbr title="Cataloging Cultural Objects">CCO</abbr> comprises of both rules and examples of the <abbr title="Categories for the Description of Works of Art">CDWA</abbr> categories and the <abbr title="Visual Resource Association">VRA</abbr> Core 4.0 for describing, documenting, and cataloguing cultural works and their visual surrogates<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn48" id="fnref48">[48]</a></sup> (Coburn et al., 2010, pp. 17–18). Both <abbr title="Cataloging Cultural Objects">CCO</abbr> and <abbr title="Categories for the Description of Works of Art">CDWA</abbr> are standards that the <abbr title="ICOM International Committee for Documentation">CIDOC</abbr><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49">[49]</a></sup> recommends and supports for museum documentation.</p>
<p><abbr title="Lightweight Information Describing Objects">LIDO</abbr><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn50" id="fnref50">[50]</a></sup> is a <abbr title="ICOM International Committee for Documentation">CIDOC</abbr> standard introduced in the early 2000s which offers a lightweight <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>-based serialisation used for describing museum-related information – as shown in <a href="#lst:lido-xml">Code Snippet 3.2</a>. It provides a format for the interchange of data about art and <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> objects, complementing <abbr title="Categories for the Description of Works of Art">CDWA</abbr> and <abbr title="Cataloging Cultural Objects">CCO</abbr> as it integrates and extends <abbr title="Categories for the Description of Works of Art">CDWA</abbr> Lite with elements of <abbr title="CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model">CIDOC-CRM</abbr> (Stein &amp; Balandi, 2019, p. 1025). Ultimately, <abbr title="Lightweight Information Describing Objects">LIDO</abbr>'s goal is to enhance interoperability, accessibility, and the sharing of collection information, enabling institutions to connect and showcase their collections in diverse contexts (Coburn et al., 2010, p. 3). <abbr title="Lightweight Information Describing Objects">LIDO</abbr> is also a <abbr title="ICOM International Committee for Documentation">CIDOC</abbr> Working Group, which are created to tackle particular issues or areas of interest<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51">[51]</a></sup>.</p>

<p><abbr title="CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model">CIDOC-CRM</abbr><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn52" id="fnref52">[52]</a></sup>, developed since 1996 by the <abbr title="ICOM International Committee for Documentation">CIDOC</abbr> and more specifically maintained by the <abbr title="CIDOC-CRM Special Interest Group">CRM-SIG</abbr> — which convenes quarterly<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn53" id="fnref53">[53]</a></sup>, is a formal and top-level ontology that offers a comprehensive conceptual framework for describing <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> resources, allowing for a deep understanding of relationships between different entities, events, and concepts for museums (Doerr, 2003, pp. 75–76). It aims to provide a common semantic framework for information integration, supporting robust knowledge representation and fostering collaboration and interoperability within the <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> sector as it can also mediate different resources from libraries and archives. The latest stable version of the conceptual model is version 7.1.2<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn54" id="fnref54">[54]</a></sup>, published in June 2022, and comprises of 81 classes and 160 properties<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn55" id="fnref55">[55]</a></sup> (see Bekiari et al., 2021).</p>
<p>Within the base ontology of <abbr title="CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model">CIDOC-CRM</abbr> – or CRMBase – and despite the emergence of new developments and gradual changes, there is a fundamental and stable core that can be succinctly outlined. This fundamental structure acts as a basic orientation for understanding the way in which data is structured within <abbr title="CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model">CIDOC-CRM</abbr>. Examining the hierarchical structure of CIDOC-CRM, one can identify the main top-level branches, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>E18 Physical Thing</code>:   This class comprises all persistent physical items with a relatively     stable form, human-made or natural.</li>
<li><code>E28 Conceptual Object</code>:   This class comprises non-material products of our minds and other     human produced data that have become objects of a discourse about     their identity, circumstances of creation or historical implication.     The production of such information may have been supported by the     use of technical devices such as cameras or computers.</li>
<li><code>E39 Actor</code>:   This class comprises people, either individually or in groups, who     have the potential to perform intentional actions of kinds for which     someone may be held responsible.</li>
<li><code>E53 Place</code>:   This class comprises extents in the natural space we live in, in     particular on the surface of the Earth, in the pure sense of     physics: independent from temporal phenomena and matter. They may     serve describing the physical location of things or phenomena or     other areas of interest.</li>
<li><code>E2 Temporal Entity</code>:   This class comprises all phenomena, such as the instances of     <code>E4 Periods</code> and <code>E5 Events</code>, which happen over a limited extent in     time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Complemented by entities tailored for the documentation of <code>E41 Appellation</code> and <code>E55 Type</code>, the structure – as shown in <a href="#fig:CRMbase">Figure 3.6</a> – provides a potent set of means to capture a broad range of general-level <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> reasoning in a holistic manner [(Bruseker et al., 2017) pp. 111-112].</p>

<p>CRMBase, is supplemented by a series of extensions – sometimes referred to as the <abbr title="CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model">CIDOC-CRM</abbr> family of models – intended to support various types of specialised research questions and documentation, such as bibliographic records or geographical data. These compatible models<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn56" id="fnref56">[56]</a></sup>, ordered alphabetically, include both works in progress and models to be reviewed by <abbr title="CIDOC-CRM Special Interest Group">CRM-SIG</abbr><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn57" id="fnref57">[57]</a></sup>. They comprise as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>CRMact<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn58" id="fnref58">[58]</a></sup>:    An extension that defines classes and properties for     integrating documentation records about plans for future activities     and future events.</li>
<li>CRMarchaeo<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn59" id="fnref59">[59]</a></sup>:    An extension of <abbr title="CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model">CIDOC-CRM</abbr> created to support the archaeological     excavation process and all the various entities and activities     related to it.</li>
<li>CRMba<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn60" id="fnref60">[60]</a></sup>:    An ontology for documenting archaeological buildings. Its     primary purpose is to facilitate the recording of evidence and     material changes in archaeological structures.</li>
<li>CRMdig<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn61" id="fnref61">[61]</a></sup>:    An ontology to encode metadata about the steps and methods of     production (‘provenance’) of digitisation products and synthetic digital     representations such as 2D, <abbr title="three-dimensional">3D</abbr> or even animated models created by     various technologies.</li>
<li>CRMgeo<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn62" id="fnref62">[62]</a></sup>:    An ontology intended to be used as a global schema for     integrating spatio-temporal properties of temporal entities and     persistent items. Its primary purpose is to provide a schema     consistent with the <abbr title="CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model">CIDOC-CRM</abbr> to integrate geoinformation using the     conceptualisations, formal definitions, encoding standards and     topological relations.</li>
<li>CRMinf<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn63" id="fnref63">[63]</a></sup>:    An extension of <abbr title="CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model">CIDOC-CRM</abbr> that facilitates argumentation and     inference in descriptive and historical fields. It serves as a     universal schema for merging metadata related to argumentation and     inference, primarily focusing on these disciplines.</li>
<li>CRMsci<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn64" id="fnref64">[64]</a></sup>:    The Scientific Observation Model is an ontology that extends     <abbr title="CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model">CIDOC-CRM</abbr>     for scientific observation, distinguishing the process from results     and providing a formal ontology for scientific data integration and     research modelling.</li>
<li>CRMsoc<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn65" id="fnref65">[65]</a></sup>:    An ontology for integrating data about social phenomena and     constructs that are of interest in the humanities and social     sciences based on analysis of documentary evidence.</li>
<li>CRMtex<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn66" id="fnref66">[66]</a></sup>:    An extension of <abbr title="CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model">CIDOC-CRM</abbr> created to support the study of     ancient documents by identifying relevant textual entities and by     modelling the scientific process related with the investigation of     ancient texts and their features.</li>
<li><abbr title="Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records">FRBR</abbr>oo<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn67" id="fnref67">[67]</a></sup>:    An ontology intended to capture and represent the underling     semantics of bibliographic information which interprets the     conceptualisations of the <abbr title="Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records">FRBR</abbr> framework.</li>
<li>PRESSoo<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn68" id="fnref68">[68]</a></sup>:    An ontology intended to capture and reresent the underling     semantics of bibliographic information about continuing resources,     and more specifically about periodicals (journals, newspapers,     magazines, etc.). PRESSoo is also an extension of     <abbr title="Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records">FRBR</abbr>oo.</li>

<p>Linked Art<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn69" id="fnref69">[69]</a></sup>, a recent addition to this landscape, is a community-driven initiative and a metadata application profile that has been in existence since the end of 2016 (Raemy, 2022, pp. 136–137). This community – recognised as a <abbr title="ICOM International Committee for Documentation">CIDOC</abbr> Working Group – has created a common Linked Data model based on <abbr title="CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model">CIDOC-CRM</abbr> for describing artworks, their relationships, and the activities around them (see <a href="#subsec:linked-art">3.5.5</a>).</p>
<h5 id="cross-domain-metadata" tabindex="-1">3.2.3.4 Cross-domain Metadata Standards</h5>
<p>There are a few cross-domain standards that have been used to describe <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> resources. For instance, the Dublin Core Elements, containing the original core sets of fifteen basic elements, and Dublin Core Metadata Terms<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn70" id="fnref70">[70]</a></sup>, its extension, are widely used metadata standards for describing <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> resources. It provides metadata properties and classes that are applicable to a wide range of resources (Weibel &amp; Koch, 2000). Another good example is the <abbr title="Europeana Data Model">EDM</abbr> that has been specified so that national, regional and thematic aggregators in Europe can deliver resources of content providers to Europeana (see Charles &amp; Isaac, 2015; Freire &amp; Isaac, 2019).</p>
<p>Despite the presence of cross-domain standards and efforts to map between standards, whether from one version to another or across different domains, reconciling metadata from various sources remains a significant challenge in the <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> sector. Institutions may collect metadata in different ways, using different standards and schemas, making it difficult to merge and compare metadata from different sources. Additionally, metadata may be incomplete, inconsistent, or contain errors, further complicating data reconciliation. To address these challenges, standardised, interoperable metadata are necessary to enable data sharing and reuse. While the use of different metadata standards can present challenges for data reconciliation, the adoption of standardised, interoperable metadata can facilitate data sharing and reuse, promoting the long-term preservation and accessibility of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> resources. Controlled vocabularies – included in what (Zeng &amp; Qin, 2022) [pp. 24-25] called <em>‘standards for data value’</em> – such as those maintained by the Getty Research Institute<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn71" id="fnref71">[71]</a></sup>: the <abbr title="Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus">AAT</abbr>, the <abbr title="Thesaurus of Geographic Names">TGN</abbr>, and the <abbr title="Union List of Artist Names">ULAN</abbr>, as well as various kinds of <abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr> (see <a href="#subsec:kos">3.2.4</a>). These vocabularies provide a common language for describing <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> objects and can improve the interoperability of metadata across different institutions and communities.</p>
<p>Alongside metadata reconciliation comes also the question of aggregation. Apart from <abbr title="Lightweight Information Describing Objects">LIDO</abbr> in museums, the general and current operating model for aggregating <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> (meta)data is still the <abbr title="Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting">OAI-PMH</abbr> (see Raemy, 2020), which is an <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>-based standard that was initially specified in 1999 and updated in 2002 (Lagoze et al., 2002). Alas, <abbr title="Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting">OAI-PMH</abbr> does not align to contemporary needs (Van de Sompel &amp; Nelson, 2015), and there are now some alternative and web-based technologies for harvesting resources that are slowly being leveraged such as <abbr title="Activity Streams">AS</abbr> (Snell &amp; Prodromou, 2017), a <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> syntax and vocabulary for representing activities and events in social media and other web application. It can also be easily extended and used in different contexts, such as it is the case with the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> Change Discovery <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> (see <a href="#subsubsec:iiif-specs">3.5.3.3</a>) or with ActivityPub (Lemmer-Webber &amp; Tallon, 2018), a decentralised <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> protocol being leveraged by Mastodon<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn72" id="fnref72">[72]</a></sup>, a federated and open-source social network.</p>
<p>Overall, the evolution of metadata standards in the <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> domain paves the way for a more interconnected and accessible digital environment, thereby providing better access to disparate collections and facilitating cross-domain reconciliation. This transformation is complemented by a growing emphasis on web-based metadata aggregation technologies that are more suited to today’s needs.</p>
<h4 id="subsec:kos" tabindex="-1">3.2.4 Knowledge Organisation Systems</h4>
<p><abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr>, also known as concept systems or concept schemes, encompass a wide range of instruments in the area of knowledge organisation. They are distinguished by their specific structures and functions (Mazzocchi, 2018, p. 54). <abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr> include authority files, classification schemes, thesauri, topic maps, ontologies, and other related structures. Despite their differences in nature, scope and application, all share a common goal: to facilitate the structured organisation of knowledge and classification of information. According to (Zeng &amp; Qin, 2022) [p. 284], <em>‘<abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr> have a more important function: to model the underlying semantic structure of a domain and to provide semantics, navigation, and translation through labels, definitions, typing relationships, and properties for concepts’</em>. This overarching intent underpins the practice of information management and retrieval.</p>
<p>The term <abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr> <em>‘became even more popular after the encoding standard Simple Knowledge Organization System (<abbr title="Simple Knowledge Organization System">SKOS</abbr>) was recommended by W3C’</em>, although the use of such systems can be traced back over 100 years, whereas others have been created in the advent of the web [(Zeng &amp; Qin, 2022) p. 188]. According to (Hill et al., 2002) [pp. 46-47, citing (Hodge, 2000)], <abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr> can be divided into four main groups: term lists, metadata-like models, classification and categorisation, as well as relationship models.</p>
<p>Term lists encompass authority files, dictionaries, and glossaries, serving as controlled sources for managing terms, definitions, and variant names within a knowledge organisation framework. Metadata-like models encompass directories and gazetteers, offering lists of names and associated contact information as well as geospatial dictionaries for named places, with can be extended for representing events and time periods. In the classification and categorisation domain, you find categorisation schemes and classification schemes that organise content, subject headings that represent controlled terms for collection items, and taxonomies that group items based on specific characteristics. Finally, relationship models feature ontologies, semantic networks, and thesauri, each capturing complex relationships between concepts and terms [(Hill et al., 2002); (Zeng, 2008)]. <a href="#fig:types-kos">Figure 3.8</a> represents an overview of the structure and functions of these four main groups, showcasing as well the subcategories of <abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr> previously mentioned. In this figure, the <code>x</code> characters indicate the extent to which each type of KOS embodies five key functions identified by (Zeng, 2008), such as eliminating ambiguity or controlling synonyms.</p>
<p>In this subsection, I will explore four subcategories of <abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr>, each representing a continuum from a more linear to a more structured network. These include folksonomy, taxonomy, thesaurus, and ontology. These <abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr> have been selected due to their significant impact on the organisation and interlinking of data within the contexts of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage Institution">CHI</abbr> practices and <abbr title="Linked Open Data">LOD</abbr>. Furthermore, the intent of these systems is to help bridge the gap between human understanding and machine processing.</p>

<h5 id="subsubsec:foklsonomy" tabindex="-1">3.2.4.1 Folksonomy</h5>
<p>Positioned at one end of the organisational spectrum, folksonomies, also known as community tagging or social bookmarking, are characterised by their user-generated nature. These systems rely on individual users’ tagging of content with keywords or tags that reflect their personal perspectives and preferences. Folksonomies as integration or reconciliation is often hard to achieve [(Zeng &amp; Qin, 2022) p. 401]. However, they do provide a wealth of source material for studying social semantics [(Zeng &amp; Qin, 2022) p. 403] and can be done in parallel to more structured <abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr>.</p>
<h5 id="subsubsec:taxonomy" tabindex="-1">3.2.4.2 Taxonomy</h5>
<p>Moving towards the centre of the spectrum, taxonomies present a more structured approach to knowledge organisation. [(Zeng, 2008) p. 169].</p>
<p>Taxonomies employ hierarchical classifications to systematically categorise information into distinct classes and sub-classes, or in a parent/child relationship (SAA Dictionary, 2023) - as shown by <a href="#lst:taxonomy">Code Snippet 3.3</a> (NISO, 2010, p. 18). Taxonomy, in this context, extends beyond mere categorisation; it also establishes relationships.</p>

</figure>
<h5 id="subsubsec:thesaurus" tabindex="-1">3.2.4.3 Thesaurus</h5>
<p>Moving further along the spectrum, thesauri offer a more detailed and formalised method of organisation. They include not only hierarchical relationships but also explicit semantic connections between terms, making them valuable tools for information retrieval. As defined by (NISO, 2010) [p. 9]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A thesaurus is a controlled vocabulary arranged in a known order and structured so that the various relationships among terms are displayed clearly and identified by standardized relationship indicators.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For instance, consider a thesaurus related to photography, which encompasses categories for various aspects of photography, including photographic techniques, equipment, and materials. Within this taxonomy, ‘Kodachrome’ could be categorised not only as a specific type of colour film but also as a distinct photographic process. As a type, it could fall under the sub-category of ‘colour film photography’, and as a process, it would fit within the broader framework of ‘photographic techniques’.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus">AAT</abbr>, commonly employed in the <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> domain, stands as a significant example of a thesaurus (Harpring, 2010, p. 67). Homosaurus<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn73" id="fnref73">[73]</a></sup> is another example of a thesaurus with a distinct focus on enhancing the accessibility and discoverability of <abbr title="lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, intersex, asexual, and more">LGBTQ+</abbr> resources and related information. Leveraging Homosaurus in metadata can effectively contribute to diminishing biases present in such data, an essential step in promoting inclusivity and equity within information systems (see Hardesty &amp; Nolan, 2021).</p>
<h5 id="subsubsec:ontology" tabindex="-1">3.2.4.4 Ontology</h5>
<p>At the structured end of the spectrum, ontologies define complex relationships and attributes between concepts, whereby a series of concepts have been chosen to express what we understand, so that a computer can start making sense of our world. Ontologies are formalised <abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr>, enabling advanced data integration and <abbr title="Knowledge Representation">KR</abbr> for more sophisticated applications. The term is drawn from philosophy, where an ontology is a discipline concerned with studying the nature of existence, as articulated by (Gruber, 1993) [pp. 199-200]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An ontology is an explicit specification of a conceptualization. The term is borrowed from philosophy, where an ontology is a systematic account of Existence. For knowledge-based systems, what “exists” is exactly that which can be represented.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are different kinds of ontologies, including axiomatic formal ontologies, foundational ontologies, and domain-specific ontologies (Beretta, 2022). These different types of ontologies cater to various knowledge representation needs. Foundational ontologies, such as <abbr title="Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering">DOLCE</abbr> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn74" id="fnref74">[74]</a></sup>, provide a high-level framework for modelling knowledge and offers a comprehensive system for representing entities, qualities, and relationships (Borgo et al., 2022; see Masolo et al., 2003).</p>
<p><abbr title="Description logic">DL</abbr>s, a family of formal <abbr title="Knowledge Representation">KR</abbr> languages, play also a key role in developing ontologies and serve as the foundation for <abbr title="Web Ontology Language">OWL</abbr> (see <a href="#sub:semanticweb">3.4.2</a>), notably by providing a logical formalism. <abbr title="Description logic">DL</abbr>s are characterised by their ability to provide substantial expressive power that goes well beyond propositional logic, while maintaining decidable reasoning (Chang et al., 2014).</p>
<p>In computer science, the concepts of <abbr title="Assertion Box">ABox</abbr> and <abbr title="Terminological Box">TBox</abbr>, both statements in <abbr title="Knowledge Base">KB</abbr>s, are relevant to the structuring and enrichment of <abbr title="Knowledge Graph">KG</abbr>s (Giacomo &amp; Lenzerini, 1996)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn75" id="fnref75">[75]</a></sup>. The <abbr title="Assertion Box">ABox</abbr>, representing the ‘assertion’ or ‘instance’ level, encapsulates concrete data instances and their relationships, contributing to the factual knowledge of a given system. Conversely, the <abbr title="Terminological Box">TBox</abbr>, representing the ‘terminology’ or ‘schema’ level, defines the conceptual framework and hierarchies that govern the relationships and attributes of the instances. These two complementary components work in harmony to improve data interoperability, reasoning and knowledge sharing. <a href="#fig:dl-system">Figure 3.9</a> depicts a high-level overview of a <abbr title="Knowledge Base">KB</abbr> representation system.</p>
<figure id="fig:dl-system" style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="data/Figures/dl-system.png" alt="Knowledge Base Representation System Based on (Patrón et al., 2011) [p. 205]" style="max-width: 80%; height: auto;">
  <figcaption>
    <strong>Figure 3.9:</strong> Knowledge Base Representation System Based on (Patrón et al., 2011) [p. 205]

</figure>
<p>Consider a scenario around artwork provenance held in a museum. The <abbr title="Assertion Box">ABox</abbr> strives to encapsulate the rich narratives of individual artworks, tracing their journey through time, ownership transitions and exhibition travels. At the same time, the <abbr title="Terminological Box">TBox</abbr> creates a conceptual scaffolding, imbued with classes such as <code>Artwork</code>, <code>Creator</code>, and <code>Exhibition</code>, painting an abstract portrait that contextualises each artefact within a broader cultural tapestry. It is here that the <abbr title="Description logic">DL</abbr> comes in, harmonising the symphony with its logical relationships and axioms, i.e. a rule or principle widely accepted as obviously true (Baader &amp; Lutz, 2007). The <abbr title="Description logic">DL</abbr> is represented as 𝒦 = (𝒯, ℛ, 𝒜), where:</p>
<ul>
<li>𝒯:   represents the <abbr title="Terminological Box">TBox</abbr>, defining the conceptual framework,     which encompasses the hierarchical relationships, classes, and     concepts within the <abbr title="Knowledge Base">KB</abbr>.</li>
<li>ℛ:   represents the set of binary roles, delineating the relationships     and connections between individuals or instances in the domain.     These roles facilitate the understanding of how entities relate to     one another within the <abbr title="Knowledge Base">KB</abbr>.</li>
<li>𝒜:   represents the <abbr title="Assertion Box">ABox</abbr>, encompassing the specific assertions     or instances in the <abbr title="Knowledge Base">KB</abbr>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This symbiotic interplay ensures that the provenance of each artwork is not just a static account, but a dynamic, interconnected narrative. The <abbr title="Assertion Box">ABox</abbr>-<abbr title="Terminological Box">TBox</abbr> relationship thrives in the realm of reasoning. Imagine an axiom embedded in the <abbr title="Terminological Box">TBox</abbr>: ‘A work of art presented in an exhibition curated by a distinguished patron is of heightened cultural significance’, or here phrased in <abbr title="Description logic">DL</abbr> terms: ∃ <code>curates.Artwork.CulturalSignificance</code> ⊑ <code>true</code>. This axiom serves as a beacon to guide the system’s reasoning. When an <abbr title="Assertion Box">ABox</abbr> instance of an artwork is woven into an exhibition curated by a prominent authority, the <abbr title="Description logic">DL</abbr>-informed engine responds by inferring an enriched cultural value that resonates beyond the artefact itself. This is where the <abbr title="Terminological Box">TBox</abbr> takes data and gives it life, producing insights that transcend the boundaries of individual instances. The <abbr title="Knowledge Base">KB</abbr>, 𝒦, captures this orchestration, encapsulating the logical relationships for meaningful interpretation and knowledge discovery.</p>
<p>Overall, the relationship between <abbr title="Assertion Box">ABox</abbr> and <abbr title="Terminological Box">TBox</abbr> in <abbr title="Description logic">DL</abbr> is vital for achieving semantic clarity, enabling meaningful data integration, and facilitating advanced reasoning mechanisms. The museum provenance scenario showcases a precisely orchestrated convergence of assertion, terminology, and rigorous logical reasoning. This engenders a computational landscape where historical artefacts intricately mesh within the complex network of human history’s data structures, seamlessly aligning with the underlying framework of algorithmic representation. These components enable software developers to harmonise disparate datasets, extract insightful knowledge, and support decision-making processes across a wide range of domains. In essence, the use of <abbr title="Description logic">DL</abbr>, <abbr title="Assertion Box">ABox</abbr>, and <abbr title="Terminological Box">TBox</abbr> in ontological <abbr title="Knowledge Representation">KR</abbr> enhances interoperability between different systems and allows for sophisticated reasoning and decision support.</p>
<p>Moving beyond these foundational concepts, it is noteworthy to consider the work of (Ehrlinger &amp; Wöß, 2016), who address the need for a clear and standardised definition of <abbr title="Knowledge Graph">KG</abbr>s. They highlight the term’s varied interpretations since its popularisation by Google in 2012 and propose a definitive, unambiguous definition to foster a common understanding and wider adoption in both academic and commercial realms. They define a <abbr title="Knowledge Graph">KG</abbr> as follows: ‘A knowledge graph acquires and integrates information into an ontology and applies a reasoner to derive new knowledge’. This definition crystallises the essence of <abbr title="Knowledge Graph">KG</abbr>s as dynamic and integrative systems that not only store but also process and enrich data through advanced reasoning. This conceptualisation underlines the transformative potential of <abbr title="Knowledge Graph">KG</abbr>s in various domains, bridging the gap between raw data and actionable insights.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to recognise that the importance of ontologies extends beyond individual systems. Shared ontologies are a cornerstone of semantic interoperability, thus facilitating a paradigm shift in the way systems and applications communicate. As (Sanderson, 2013) argues: <em>’shared ontologies increases semantic interoperability’</em> and <em>‘shared identity makes it possible for graph to merge serendipitously’</em>. This shared understanding ensures that various entities can seamlessly connect and engage in meaningful interactions.</p>
<h3 id="sec:movements" tabindex="-1">3.3 Trends, Movements, and Principles</h3>
<p>Technological trends, scientific movements, and guiding principles have played a crucial role in shaping the landscape of contemporary research. In recent years, there has been an increased emphasis on the need for academic and <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> practices to be more transparent, inclusive, and accountable. This shift reflects a broader trend towards integrating advanced technological solutions and open-science principles in heritage management. As such, understanding the evolution of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> becomes imperative to comprehend how these practices have adapted and transformed in response to these guiding trends.</p>
<p>The evolution of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> has been characterised by a series of technological and methodological shifts. Initially, the primary focus was on digitising physical artefacts to preserve information from degrading originals. This phase was crucial for transitioning tangible <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> into a digital format, mitigating the risk of loss due to physical degradation. Following this, efforts shifted towards ensuring the persistence of digitised resources. This stage involved addressing challenges related to digital preservation, including data degradation and format obsolescence, to ensure the longevity of digital cultural assets.</p>
<p>The advent of open data principles marked the next phase in <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> development. This approach facilitated broader access to information, aligning with contemporary values of transparency and inclusivity in, governmental, academic, and cultural contexts. Subsequently, the focus expanded to enhancing the utility of this data. This stage involved contextualising and enriching <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data, thereby increasing their applicability and relevance across various domains.</p>
<p>The current frontier in <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> involves developing applications that leverage rich <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data. These applications serve not only as tools for engagement and education but also as justifications for the ongoing costs associated with data storage and archival. They illustrate the tangible benefits derived from preserving heritage resources, encompassing both cultural and economic returns. In summary, the trajectory of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> development mirrors broader technological and societal trends, transitioning from preservation to active utilisation. This progression underscores the dynamic nature of research and <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> processes, highlighting the evolving requirements for transparency, inclusivity, and accountability in <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> management.</p>
<p>While automation has significantly enhanced the efficiency of digitisation processes in <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>, cataloguing and indexing remain complex challenges. The intricacies involved in accurately understanding and categorising resources necessitate more than just technological solutions; they require context-aware and culturally sensitive approaches. Here, <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> offers promising perspectives. <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr>, particularly in its advanced forms like deep learning, can assist in cataloguing and indexing by analysing large datasets to identify patterns, categorise content, and even suggest metadata. This can be particularly useful in handling large volumes of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data, where manual processing is time-consuming and prone to human error. Typical applications of <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> in this field include image recognition for identifying and classifying visual elements in artefacts, <abbr title="Natural Language Processing">NLP</abbr> for analysing textual content, and pattern recognition for sorting and organising data based on specific characteristics. Furthermore, prospective developments may entail the refinement of metadata mapping and the enhancement of quality control mechanisms. Moreover, <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> algorithms can be trained to recognise stylistic elements, historical contexts, and other nuances that are essential for accurate cataloguing in <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>. However, it is crucial to note that the effectiveness of <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> depends heavily on the quality and diversity of the training data. Biases in this data can lead to inaccuracies in cataloguing and indexing. Thus, a collaborative approach, where <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> is supplemented by expert human oversight, is often the most effective strategy.</p>
<p>Overall, this section provides a comprehensive overview of <s>six</s> <strong>three</strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26:1">[26:1]</a></sup> technological trends as well as five key scientific movements and guiding principles that are shaping research and how universities and <abbr title="Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums">GLAM</abbr>s should provide environments, services, and tools with a view to collecting and disseminating content. By exploring each of these trends, movements, and principles, we can gain a deeper understanding of how research and <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> processes are permeated by dynamic movements and how resources can be made more transparent, inclusive and accountable, as well as how data can be made available to human and non-human users.</p>
<h4 id="subsec:current-emerging-trends" tabindex="-1">3.3.1 Current and Emerging Technological Trends in Cultural Heritage</h4>
<p>I will explore some current and emerging technological trends in <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>, organised into three components: Linked Data, big data, and <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>. Each represents a critical driver shaping the landscape and practices of heritage data. The three trends have been around for a few decades, with the ‘Linked Data’ principles and underlying standards coming from the late 1990s, ‘big data’ being coined in 1990 and <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> in 1956.</p>
<p>Before considering the trends discussed hereafter, note that current technological developments do not exist in isolation, but tend to intertwine and act synergistically. A vivid example of this interplay can be seen in <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> and its latent impact on the semantic web, particularly in facilitating more efficient querying and crawling processes such as the LinkedDataGPT proof-of-concept service<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn76" id="fnref76">[76]</a></sup> from Liip on the City of Zurich that combines ChatGPT — a generative <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> solution — on top of a Linked Data portal to facilitate querying open datasets (Stocker, 2023). Inversely <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> can be fed by data on the web to learn and reason, as outlined by 
</p><h5 id="subsubsec:linked_data" tabindex="-1">3.3.1.1 Linked Data</h5>
<p>Linked Data, and most precisely <abbr title="Linked Open Data">LOD</abbr>, is a set of design principles adhering to <abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr> which is a significant approach to interconnect data on the web in order to make semantic queries more useful (Berners-Lee et al., 2001). In other words, this standardisation allows data to be not only linked, but also openly accessible and reusable. As noted by (Gandon, 2019) [p. 115, citing (Gandon, 2017)]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Web was initially perceived and used as a globally distributed hypertext space for humans. But from its inception, the Web has always been more: its hypermedia architecture is in fact linking programs world-wide through remote procedure calls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This deeper understanding of the web’s architecture as a conduit for linking programs on a global scale holds profound implications. It signifies that the web is not merely a medium for accessing information but a dynamic environment where data-driven programs interact, exchange data, and collaborate across geographical boundaries. In this context, Linked Data emerges as a powerful enabler, providing a structured and standardised approach for these programs to communicate and share meaningful data (Bizer et al., 2008).</p>
<p>In the context of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>, institutions such as museums, libraries and archives can publish their collections using Linked Data principles, enabling a web of linked information that is accessible to all. As this dissertation’s main topic revolves around Linked (Open) (Usable) Data, two dedicated sections have been written within this literature review in <a href="#sec:linkeddata">Section 3.4</a> and <a href="#sec:loud">Section 3.5</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond formal <abbr title="Linked Open Data">LOD</abbr>, <abbr title="Cultural Heritage Institution">CHI</abbr>s may also link their databases or collections in more informal ways. This interconnection may take the form of shared metadata, common identifiers, or simply hyperlinks. These links can enhance the user experience by supporting a more seamless navigation between related items or pieces of information. For instance, a parallel strategy is the use of graph-based data representation, i.e. property graph which consists of a set of objects or vertices, and a set of arrows or edges connecting the objects, that are most likely not <abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr>-compliant (see Bermès, 2023). Graph databases, such as Neo4j<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn77" id="fnref77">[77]</a></sup> which is quite prevalent in <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> (Darmont et al., 2020; Drakopoulos et al., 2019; see Webber, 2012), allow for efficient storage and retrieval of interconnected data through nodes representing entities and relationships linking them.</p>
<h5 id="subsubsec:big_data" tabindex="-1">3.3.1.2 Big Data</h5>
<p>Big Data refers to extremely large and complex datasets that exceed the capabilities of traditional data processing methods and tools. It encompasses a massive volume of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data that is currently flooding across a variety of sectors, companies and organisations (see Emmanuel &amp; Stanier, 2016). The characteristics of big data are often described by the three ⋁ model (Laney, 2001):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Volume</strong>:   Big data refers to a massive amount of data. This can encompass a     spectrum of data sizes, extending from <abbr title="Gigabytes">GB</abbr> and <abbr title="Terabytes">TB</abbr>, to <abbr title="Petabytes">PB</abbr><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn78" id="fnref78">[78]</a></sup> and beyond. The sheer size of     the data is a key aspect of big data, making traditional database     systems inadequate for storage and analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Velocity</strong>:   Data is being generated and collected at an unprecedented rate.     Social media posts, sensor data, online transactions and more are     constantly being generated, requiring real-time or near real-time     processing and analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Variety</strong>:   Big data comes in a variety of formats, including structured data     (e.g. databases), semi-structured data (e.g.     <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>,     <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr>) and     unstructured data (e.g. text, images, video). The variety of data     types requires flexible processing methods.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the three ⋁ model, two more characteristics are often included (Saha &amp; Srivastava, 2014, p. 1294):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Veracity</strong>:   It refers to the quality of the data, including its accuracy,     reliability and trustworthiness. Big data sources can be inherently     uncertain or inaccurate, and addressing data quality is a critical     challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Value</strong>:   Extracting value and actionable insights from big data is the     ultimate goal. Analysing and interpreting Big data should lead to     better decision-making, improved business strategies, as well as     enhanced <abbr title="User experience">UX</abbr><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn79" id="fnref79">[79]</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding the two latter dimensions, (Debattista et al., 2015) argue that that Linked Data is the most suitable technology to increase the value of data over conventional formats, thus contributing towards the value challenge in Big Data. As for veracity, they describe a semantic pipeline with eight key metrics to address the veracity dimension. Building on this technological foundation, the integration of Linked Data and Big Data analytics takes centre stage.</p>
<p>Big data analytics can be employed on <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> content to uncover insights and correlations that can be used in decision-making. (Barrile &amp; Bernardo, 2022) [p. 2708] highlight the transformative potential of using big data by investigating how analytical approach can enhance conservation strategies, aid resource allocation and optimise the management of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> resources. (Poulopoulos &amp; Wallace, 2022) [pp. 188-189] emphasise that emerging technology trends, including big data, have a significant impact on related research areas such as <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>. Big data primarily originates from sources such as social media, online gaming, data lakes<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn80" id="fnref80">[80]</a></sup>, logs and frameworks that generate or use significant amounts of data. They stress that the incorporation of multi-faceted analytics in the <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> domain is an area of active research, and present a data lake that provides essential user and data/knowledge management functionalities. However, they emphasise a crucial consideration - the need to bridge the theoretical foundations of disciplines such as cultural sociology with the technological advances of big data.</p>
<h5 id="subsubsec:ch_ai" tabindex="-1">3.3.1.3 Artificial Intelligence</h5>
<p><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> has been coined for the first time by John McCarthy, an American computer scientist and cognitive scientist, during the 1956 Dartmouth Conference, which is often considered the birth of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> as an academic field (Andresen, 2002, p. 84). According to the (Oxford English Dictionary, 2023), <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> is described as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The capacity of computers or other machines to exhibit or simulate intelligent behaviour; the field of study concerned with this. In later use also: software used to perform tasks or produce output previously thought to require human intelligence, esp. by using machine learning to extrapolate from large collections of data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> is not the central focus of my PhD thesis, I acknowledge its impact in several instances. As a rapidly developing technology, <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> has the potential to significantly transform various aspects of society, including the way we describe, analyse, and disseminate <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> resources. It is worth mentioning that I endeavour to engage in a broader discourse concerning the domain of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>. In this context, I use the acronyms <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> to talk about the overarching domain or its ethics, and <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> to discuss the specifics of methodologies and algorithmic approaches, while refraining from delving into the intricacies of Deep Learning, which is a distinct subdomain within <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr>.</p>
<p><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> and <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> offer great potential for digitising, curating and analysing <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>, leveraging the vast digital datasets from <abbr title="Cultural Heritage Institution">CHI</abbr>s. Some of the examples include text recognition mechanisms using <abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr> and <abbr title="Handwritten Text Recognition">HTR</abbr>, <abbr title="Natural Language Processing">NLP</abbr> and <abbr title="Named Entity Recognition">NER</abbr> for enriching unstructured text, as well as object detection methods for finding patterns within still and moving images (Neudecker, 2022; Sporleder, 2010). Textual works can also be analysed, for instance for sentiment analysis (see Susnjak, 2023), and generated using <abbr title="Large Language Models">LLM</abbr> – a variety of <abbr title="Natural Language Processing">NLP</abbr>, such as BERT or ChatGPT, which predicts the likelihood of a word given the previous words present in recorded texts. However, challenges such as data quality and biases in <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> persist (Neudecker, 2022).</p>
<p>In addition, there are still uncertainties regarding the licensing and reuse of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> datasets by <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> algorithms<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn81" id="fnref81">[81]</a></sup>. (Neudecker, 2022) emphasises the importance of well-curated digitised <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> resources that are openly licensed, accompanied by relevant metadata, and accessible through <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s or download dumps in various formats. These curated resources have the potential to address the existing gap in this domain.</p>
<p>Building on the theme of enhancing <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> through digital technologies, (McGillivray et al., 2020) explore the synergies and challenges found at the intersection of <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> and <abbr title="Natural Language Processing">NLP</abbr>. <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> is aptly described as <em>‘a nexus of fields within which scholars use computing technologies to investigate the kinds of questions that are traditional to the humanities […] or who ask traditional kinds of humanities-oriented questions about computing technologies’</em> (Fitzpatrick, 2010). This broad characterisation encapsulates the transformative potential of digital tools, including <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> techniques, in enriching humanities research.</p>
<p>(McGillivray et al., 2020) highlight the critical need for bridging the communication gap between <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> and <abbr title="Natural Language Processing">NLP</abbr> to drive progress in both fields. They propose increased interdisciplinary collaboration, encouraging <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> researchers to actively utilise <abbr title="Natural Language Processing">NLP</abbr> tools to refine their research methodologies. A primary challenge in this convergence is the application of <abbr title="Natural Language Processing">NLP</abbr> to the complex, historical, or noisy texts often encountered in <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> research. They conclude by advocating for stronger cooperation between practitioners in these fields. This collaborative effort is vital for harnessing the full potential of <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> in analysing and interpreting <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>.</p>
<p>The use of <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> scripts in the context of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> — and beyond — is inherently limited by their applicability, namely when dealing with historical photographs. In such cases, the use of algorithms that are mostly trained and grounded in contemporary image data becomes quite incongruous due to the dissimilarity in temporal contexts. This dilemma is exemplified by datasets such as Microsoft’s Common Object in Context (COCO)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn82" id="fnref82">[82]</a></sup> (Lin et al., 2014), where the available data are predominantly contemporary photographic content, which is misaligned with the historical nuances inherent in most of the digitised <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> images. (Coleman, 2020) corroborates that a sound approach would be for <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> practitioners to collaborate with libraries as they can draw practical lessons from critical data studies and the thoughtful integration of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> into their collections, using guidelines from <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr>. She also advocates that as handing handing over datasets would be a disservice to library patrons and that <em>‘Librarians need to master the instruments of AI and employ them both to learn more about their own resources—to see and analyze them in new ways—and to help shape applications of AI with the expertise and ethos of libraries.’</em></p>
<p>Ethical concerns, particularly regarding social biases and racism, are prevalent in technologies like ImageNet, where facial recognition may yield <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> statements with strong negative connotations (Neudecker, 2022). Addressing this, (Gandon, 2019) suggest the production of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> services that are <em>‘benevolent-by-design for the good of the Web and society’</em>. Furthermore, (Floridi, 2023) introduces the double-charge thesis, asserting that all technology design is a moral act, challenging the neutrality thesis. He emphasises that technologies are not neutral and can be influenced by a dynamic equilibrium of values, predisposing them towards morally good or evil directions.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, the <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> training datasets are often not enough representative to be properly leveraged in the <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> sector (Strien et al., 2022). Fine-tuning is now a topic though and new ground truth datasets have been created and tailored for the needs of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>, such as Viscounth<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn83" id="fnref83">[83]</a></sup>, a large-scale <abbr title="Visual Question Answering">VQA</abbr> dataset — i.e a dataset containing open-ended questions about images which requires an understanding of vision, language and commonsense knowledge to answer (Goyal et al., 2017) — for <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> in English and Italian (see Becattini et al., 2023).</p>
<p>(Jaillant &amp; Caputo, 2022) argue that the governance of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> ought to be carried out in partnership with <abbr title="Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums">GLAM</abbr> institutions. However, while this collaboration has been proposed as a promising way forward, it still requires further exploration and evaluation, particularly with regards to the specific challenges and opportunities that it presents. On the one hand, the involvement of <abbr title="Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums">GLAM</abbr>s in <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> governance could enhance the development of digital <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> projects that promote social justice and equity. However, on the other hand, this collaboration raises several challenges, such as the need to address issues of privacy, data protection, and intellectual property rights, and to ensure that the values and perspectives of <abbr title="Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums">GLAM</abbr> professionals are adequately represented in the development of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> algorithms and systems. Therefore, it is crucial to examine the specific challenges and opportunities of this collaboration and to develop appropriate frameworks and guidelines that enable effective and ethical governance of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> in the <abbr title="Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums">GLAM</abbr> sector.</p>
<p>One of these platforms that address these issues is AI4LAM, which is an international and participatory community focused on advancing the use of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> in, for and by libraries, archives, and museums<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn84" id="fnref84">[84]</a></sup>. The initiative was launched by the National Library of Norway and Stanford University Libraries in 2018 inspired by the success of the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> community. Another agency is the AEOLIAN Network<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn85" id="fnref85">[85]</a></sup>, <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> for Cultural Organisations, which investigates the role that <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> can play to make born-digital and digitised cultural records more accessible to users (Jaillant &amp; Rees, 2023, p. 582).</p>
<p>As an illustrative case, the <abbr title="Library of Congress">LoC</abbr>'s exploration into <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> technologies, as highlighted by (Allen, 2023), demonstrates a strategic commitment to enhancing the accessibility and utility of its diverse collections. This initiative reflects the <abbr title="Library of Congress">LoC</abbr>'s acknowledgement of the transformative potential of <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr>, balanced with a cautious approach due to the necessity for accurate and responsible information stewardship. The <abbr title="Library of Congress">LoC</abbr> faces several challenges in applying <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr>, particularly the limitations of commercial <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> systems in handling its varied materials and the requirement for substantial human intervention. This cautious exploration into <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> is indicative of a broader trend in <abbr title="Cultural Heritage Institution">CHI</abbr>s, where maintaining a balance between embracing technological advancements and preserving authenticity and integrity is crucial.</p>
<p>The specific experiments and projects undertaken by the <abbr title="Library of Congress">LoC</abbr> in the realm of <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> are diverse and illustrative of the institution’s comprehensive approach to innovation. For instance, image recognition systems have been tested for identifying and classifying visual elements in artefacts, a task that requires a nuanced understanding of historical and cultural contexts. In another initiative, speech-to-text technology was employed to transcribe spoken word collections, confronting challenges such as accent recognition and audio quality variation. Additionally, the <abbr title="Library of Congress">LoC</abbr> explored the potential of <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> in enhancing search and discovery capabilities through projects like Newspaper Navigator<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn86" id="fnref86">[86]</a></sup>, which aimed to identify and extract images from digitised newspaper pages.</p>
<p>These experiments not only highlight the potential of <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> in transforming the way <abbr title="Library of Congress">LoC</abbr> manages and disseminates its collections but also reveal the complexities and limitations inherent in these technologies. As (Allen, 2023) notes, the ongoing research and experimentation in <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> at the <abbr title="Library of Congress">LoC</abbr> are critical in revolutionising access and discovery in the cultural heritage sector. These efforts, while facing challenges, represent a diligent integration of advanced technologies, upholding principles of responsible custodianship and setting a precedent for similar institutions globally in the adoption and adaption of <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> and <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> in <abbr title="Cultural Heritage Institution">CHI</abbr>s.</p>
<p>The integration of <abbr title="Large Language Models">LLM</abbr> and <abbr title="Knowledge Graph">KG</abbr> presents a groundbreaking opportunity, particularly within the realm of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage Institution">CHI</abbr>s, where there is already considerable expertise. This is aptly demonstrated in the work of (Pan et al., 2023), which elucidates the harmonisation between explicit knowledge and parametric knowledge, i.e. knowledge derived from patterns in data, as learned by models such as <abbr title="Large Language Models">LLM</abbr>s. The authors highlight three key areas for the advancement of <abbr title="Knowledge Representation">KR</abbr> and processing:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Knowledge Extraction</strong>, where <abbr title="Large Language Models">LLM</abbr>s improves the extraction of knowledge     from diverse sources for applications such as information retrieval     and <abbr title="Knowledge Graph">KG</abbr>     construction;</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge Graph Construction</strong>, which involves     <abbr title="Large Language Models">LLM</abbr>s in tasks     such as link prediction and triple extraction from data, albeit with     challenges in precision and management of long tail entities;</li>
<li><strong>Training <abbr title="Large Language Models">LLM</abbr>s     Using <abbr title="Knowledge Graph">KG</abbr>s</strong>, where     <abbr title="Knowledge Graph">KG</abbr>s provides     structured knowledge for <abbr title="Large Language Models">LLM</abbr>s, helping to build retrieval-augmented     models on the fly, enriching <abbr title="Large Language Models">LLM</abbr>s with world knowledge and increasing its     adaptability.</li>
</ol>
<p>In a report for the University of Leeds in the UK, (Pirgova-Morgan, 2023) explores the potential and practical implications of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> in libraries. The project, forming part of the university’s ambitious vision for digital transformation, aims to understand how <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> can be effectively integrated into library services. This research looks at both the use of general <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> for long term strategic planning and specific <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> applications for improving <abbr title="User experience">UX</abbr>, process optimisation and enhancing the discoverability of collections. The methodology used in this study involves a multi-faceted approach including desk-based assessments, a university-wide survey and expert interviews. Specifically, the study highlights the following key findings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> for <abbr title="User experience">UX</abbr> and Process Optimisation</strong>:   The integration of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> technologies offers substantial     opportunities for improving user experiences in libraries. This     includes optimising library processes, enhancing collections     descriptions, and improving their discoverability.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges and Opportunities of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> Application</strong>:   While <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>     presents exciting possibilities, its practical application in     library settings faces challenges. These include evaluating specific     <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> technologies     in the unique context of the University of Leeds, ensuring they     align with the institution’s needs and goals.</li>
<li><strong>Perceptions of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> in Libraries</strong>:   The report reveals varying perceptions among librarians and users     regarding <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>.     This includes views on how <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> can contribute to resilience,     awareness of climate change, and practices promoting equality,     diversity, and inclusion.</li>
<li><strong>Role of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> in Strategic Library Development</strong>:   General <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>     technologies are seen as instrumental in shaping long-term     strategies for libraries, highlighting the need for ongoing     adaptation and development in response to evolving     <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Expert Perspectives on <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> in Libraries</strong>:   Interviews with experts from around the world underscore the     importance of understanding both general and specific applications     of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>. These     insights help in identifying priority areas where AI can     significantly enhance library operations and services.</li>
</ul>
<p>These insights from the University of Leeds report illustrate the complex impact of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> on library services, from enhancing user interaction to influencing strategic decision-making, while also emphasising the importance of adapting <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> applications to specific institutional needs.</p>
<p>It must be also stated that <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> lacks inherent intelligence and consciousness, and have been ultimately built by people. An important concern, namely with <abbr title="Large Language Models">LLM</abbr>, is the perceptual illusion of cognitive interaction, where the machine appears to be engaging in dialogue and reasoning, when in fact it is generating content through predictive algorithms (see Ridge, 2023). Furthermore, regarding the topic of data colonialism, poor people in underprivileged nations are often burdened with the responsibility of cleaning up the toxic repercussions of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>, shielding affluent individuals and prosperous countries from direct exposure to its harmful effects<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn87" id="fnref87">[87]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Concluding this segment, it is essential to perceive <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> algorithms as uncertain <em>‘socio-material configurations’</em>, which can be seen as both powerful and inscrutable, demanding an axiomatic and problem-oriented approach in their understanding and application. (Jaton, 2017) elaborates on this by examining how these algorithms, while technologically complex, are firmly rooted in and shaped by the social, material, and human contexts in which they are developed. Beyond their computational complexity, these algorithms are deeply embedded in the process of constructing . These ground truths are not inherent or fixed; instead, they emerge from collaborative efforts that reflect the varied inputs of actors. This process underscores the algorithms as socio-material constructs, influenced by the characteristics and contexts of their creators. Understanding algorithms in this light highlights their deep integration with human actions and societal norms, offering a more nuanced view of their design and implementation (see Jaton, 2021, 2023).</p>
<h4 id="subsec:scientific-movements-guiding-principles" tabindex="-1">3.3.2 Scientific Movements and Guiding Principles</h4>
<p>First, <a href="#subsubsec:open-scholarship">3.3.2.1</a> examines the movement towards more open and transparent forms of research. Open scholarship is a broad concept that encompasses practices such as open access publishing, open data, open source software, and open educational resources. The subsection explores the benefits and challenges of open scholarship, and how it can help to increase the accessibility and impact of research data.</p>
<p>Then, <a href="#subsubsec:citizen">3.3.2.2</a> explores the growing trend of involving members of the public in scientific research. Citizen science and citizen humanities involve collaborations between scientists and non-expert individuals, with the aim of generating new knowledge or solving complex problems. The subsubsection examines the benefits and challenges of citizen science and citizen humanities, and how they can help to democratise research.</p>
<p><a href="#subsubsec:fair">3.3.2.3</a> examines the set of guiding principles designed to ensure that research outputs are <abbr title="Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable">FAIR</abbr>. It explores the importance of each data principle for research integrity, reproducibility, and collaboration, and provides examples of how they can be implemented in practice.</p>
<p><a href="#subsubsec:care">3.3.2.4</a> explores the importance of ethical and culturally sensitive data governance practices for indigenous communities that are materialised through <abbr title="Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics">CARE</abbr>. These principles provide a framework for managing data in a way that is consistent with the values and cultural traditions of indigenous communities. This part explores as well the challenges and opportunities of implementing the <abbr title="Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics">CARE</abbr> Principles for Indigenous Data Governance.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="#subsubsec:collections-data">3.3.2.5</a> explores the concept of ‘Collections as Data’, a perspective that has emerged from the practical need and desire to improve decades of digital collecting practice. This approach re-conceptualises collections as ordered digital information that is inherently amenable to computational processing.</p>
<h5 id="subsubsec:open-scholarship" tabindex="-1">3.3.2.1 Towards Open Scholarship</h5>
<p>According to the FOSTER<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn88" id="fnref88">[88]</a></sup>, Open Science can be described as <em>‘[…] the practice of science in such a way that others can collaborate and contribute, where research data, lab notes and other research processes are freely available, under terms that enable reuse, redistribution and reproduction of the research and its underlying data and methods.’</em> (FOSTER, 2019).</p>
<p>In recent years, the principles of Open Science, that historically include Open methodology, Open source, Open data, <abbr title="Open access">OA</abbr>, Open peer review, as well as open educational resources, have become increasingly important as they emphasise transparency, collaboration and accessibility in scientific research (Bezjak et al., 2019). Open methodology refers to the sharing of research processes and methods, allowing other researchers to reproduce and build on existing work (see Vicente-Saez &amp; Martinez-Fuentes, 2018). Open source software and tools enable researchers to collaborate, while open data practices promote the sharing of research data in ways that are accessible, discoverable and reusable by others<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn89" id="fnref89">[89]</a></sup>. Open access seeks to remove financial and other barriers to accessing scientific knowledge, while open peer review provides greater transparency and accountability in the publication process. Finally, open educational resources encourage the sharing of teaching and learning materials, thereby facilitating the dissemination of knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>(UNESCO, 2019) conducted a preliminary study of the technical, financial and considerations related to the promotion of Open Science. This research underscored the necessity for a holistic approach to Open Science and stressed the significance of tackling international legal matters, as well as the existing challenges stemming from unequal access to justice, which can hinder global scientific collaboration. This study laid the groundwork for a recommendation on making <em>‘[…] multilingual scientific knowledge openly available, accessible and reusable for everyone, to increase scientific collaborations and sharing of information for the benefits of science and society, and to open the processes of scientific knowledge creation’</em> (UNESCO, 2021, p. 7). <abbr title="United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization">UNESCO</abbr> identified five types of access related to Open Science: infrastructures, societal actors, as well as associated and diverse knowledge systems where dialogue is needed. This includes acknowledging the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities to govern and make decisions on the custodianship, ownership, and administration of data on traditional knowledge and on their lands and resources. <a href="#fig:unesco-open-science">Figure 3.10</a> provides a visual summary of this.</p>
<figure id="fig:unesco-open-science" style="text-align: center;">

</figure>
<p>While Open Science offers numerous benefits, it also presents challenges and potential drawbacks that warrant careful consideration. One major concern is the risk of exacerbating inequities between researchers from well-resourced institutions and those from less privileged backgrounds. Open access publishing often entails significant costs in the form of article processing charges, which can disproportionately burden researchers without adequate funding support (Burchardt, 2014). Additionally, Open Science practices relying on open protocols may be vulnerable to misuse, such as automated bots excessively crawling open repositories or datasets. This can lead to overloading systems, unauthorised data extraction, or unintended uses of research outputs (see Irish &amp; Saba, 2023; Li et al., 2021). These risks underscore the importance of balancing openness with safeguards that ensure equitable participation and secure, sustainable access to research materials.</p>
<p>These challenges are particularly relevant in the context of <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr>, a field that harnesses the promise and impact of digital technologies and methodologies for the study and understanding of cultural phenomena. The adoption of Open Science principles has contributed to greater collaboration, transparency and accessibility in research practices in this field. Open data practices are particularly relevant, as they allow scholars to work with large and complex datasets, including digitised archives and social media data. Open educational resources can also be used to support the dissemination of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> literacy and skills, enabling wider audiences to engage with such resources. However, ensuring that such openness does not exacerbate inequities or introduce vulnerabilities requires thoughtful implementation.</p>
<p>In addition to the principles of Open Science, the concept of Open Scholarship has been introduced by (Tennant et al., 2020) as a broader approach that encompasses the arts and humanities and goes beyond the research community to the wider public. Open Scholarship emphasises the importance of making research and scholarship accessible to a wider audience, including non-experts, educators and policy makers. It can be particularly relevant to the arts and humanities, as they often deal with complex cultural materials and narratives that have wider societal implications. By making their work openly accessible and engaging with non-experts, humanities researchers can contribute to public discourse, promote cultural understanding, and inform policy and decision-making. Open scholarship can also support greater collaboration and innovation within the Arts and Humanities by enabling researchers to work collaboratively across disciplines and with a wide range of constituents. For instance, open educational resources can be used to develop collaborative teaching and learning materials that draw on the expertise of scholars and practitioners from different disciplines, while open data practices can facilitate the sharing and reuse of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> materials.</p>
<p>Conversely, (Knöchelmann, 2019) advocates for the term Open Humanities as a dedicated discourse that would within the humanities. Notably, he argues that Open Humanities should adapt key Open Science elements to the Humanities’ unique context. In the case of preprints, the challenges in the humanities, such as limited discipline-specific preprint servers and linguistic diversity, require tailored solutions to encourage adoption. Open peer review in the humanities should accommodate the field’s subjectivity and diverse perspectives. Concerns about liberal copyright licenses revolve around potential misrepresentation and plagiarism, highlighting the importance of maintaining scholarly integrity regardless of the chosen license. Knochelmann’s proposal underscores the need for context-sensitive approaches to promote openness and collaboration while respecting humanities’ distinct characteristics.</p>
<p>Overall, the principles of Open Science provide a framework for promoting greater collaboration, transparency and accessibility in research practices. Yet, the challenges discussed underscore the need for careful adaptation to address inequities, cybersecurity concerns, and field-specific nuances. The concept of Open Scholarship, which stresses the importance of making research and scholarship accessible to wider audiences, can be instrumental in broadening the impact of research in both natural sciences and the humanities, as Open Science encourages greater collaboration and innovation across disciplines. Ultimately, this underscores the need for adaptation and positions all academic disciplines as essential contributors to societal understanding, cultural preservation and informed decision-making, while ensuring the sustainability and integrity of open practices.</p>
<h5 id="subsubsec:citizen" tabindex="-1">3.3.2.2 Citizen Science, Citizen Humanities</h5>
<p>Citizen Science and Citizen Humanities are approaches that involve the public in scientific and humanities research, respectively. They have become increasingly popular in recent years as a means of democratising research and engaging the public in academic initiatives.</p>
<p>Citizen Science, as articulated by (Irwin, 1995), embodies a fundamental commitment to sourcing knowledge beyond the confines of academia, with a deliberate focus on addressing the concerns and interests of the public. This perspective underscores the transformative power of Citizen Science, making it a catalyst for a more democratic approach to scientific endeavours.</p>
<p>(Bonney, 1996)’s perspective complements this vision by framing Citizen Science as a collaborative process where amateur enthusiasts actively participate in data collection for academic science, all the while gaining a deeper understanding of scientific principles and processes. In this light, Citizen Science emerges as an ideal vehicle for science education and a potent tool for enhancing public appreciation of scientific pursuits.</p>
<p>These viewpoints loosely align with the Oxford English Dictionary’s definition, characterising Citizen Science as <em>‘scientific work undertaken by members of the general public, often in collaboration with or under the direction of professional scientists and scientific institutions’</em> and traces the earliest evidence of the term in 1989 (Oxford English Dictionary, 2023). As such, Citizen Science stands as a harmonious intersection of public engagement, education, and scientific inquiry, amplifying the voice of non-academic contributors and democratising the scientific landscape.</p>
<p>The public can play a vital role in data collection, analysis, and interpretation. This involvement can take the form of participating in wildlife sightings tracking, monitoring water quality, or assessing air pollution. By participating in these activities, citizens become direct contributors to the generation of valuable scientific data. The transformative power of Citizen Science extends across a wide spectrum of scientific disciplines, emphasising its capacity to democratise and broaden the reach of scientific endeavours (see Pelacho et al., 2021).</p>
<p>Citizen Science is a form of co-creation, whether viewed as an innovation-oriented means of value creation (Jansma et al., 2022) or as a more radical form of empowerment, reinforces the democratisation of the research process (Metz et al., 2019). It amplifies the voice of non-academic participants in scholarly pursuits, reflecting a profound shift in the way science is conducted. This collaborative model demonstrates how public engagement enriches the scientific landscape, allowing for the inclusion of different perspectives and a wider range of voices in the pursuit of knowledge. Furthermore, engaging in participatory practices also involves elements of ‘phronesis’ <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn90" id="fnref90">[90]</a></sup> (see Mehlenbacher, 2022), encompassing moral, affective, and care-oriented dimensions.</p>
<p>Trust is also a foundational and indispensable element in the landscape of participatory initiatives (see Dahlgren &amp; Hansson, 2020). The success and sustainability of projects within Citizen Science heavily rely on establishing and maintaining trust among all stakeholders involved. This trust extends in multiple directions. First and foremost, participants must trust the project organisers and platforms that host these initiatives. They must have confidence that their contributions will be used responsibly and ethically, with respect to their time and effort. When contributors are assured that their involvement is valued and that the data they provide serves a meaningful purpose, their motivation to participate and provide accurate information is bolstered. Conversely, project organisers and institutions also need to instil trust in participants. Transparency in project objectives, methodology and data use is paramount. Clear and consistent communication is essential to address participants’ concerns and provide feedback on the impact of their contributions. This two-way trust is the foundation of successful participatory projects and facilitates long-term engagement.</p>
<p>Citizen Humanities where members of the public can participate in activities such as crowdsourced transcription, tagging, and annotation of digital <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> materials. These activities can help to uncover new knowledge and insights, as well as to make <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> materials more accessible to a wider audience (Strasser &amp; Haklay, 2018). It is important to note that within the context of these terms, Citizen Science is often regarded as the broader concept, encompassing both Citizen Science and Citizen Humanities. While the primary distinction between the two may, in some cases, appear to be terminological, in practice, they both exemplify the principles of open and inclusive research, akin to the concepts of Open Science and Open Humanities discussed in the preceding subsection. These approaches foster collaboration and engagement between researchers and the public, deepening the public’s understanding and appreciation of the research process as a whole (Zourou &amp; Ziku, 2022). This inclusive perspective, even if those participatory activities have been more widely used in natural sciences than in the humanities (Lowry &amp; Stepenuck, 2021), underscores Citizen Science as an umbrella term encompassing both scientific and humanities endeavours, each enriched by the active participation of the public.</p>
<p>While Citizen Science involves the public in research, they differ from crowdsourcing projects in several ways. Crowdsourcing typically involves the outsourcing of tasks to a large group of people, often through online platforms, with the aim of completing a specific task or project (Ridge, 2017). In contrast, Citizen Science focuses more on engagement and collaboration, with the goal of involving the public in the research process and generating new knowledge. That being said, there is also a convergence between Citizen Science with crowdsourcing projects. In many cases, Citizen Science initiatives may also involve crowdsourcing tasks, such as collecting or annotating data. Similarly, crowdsourcing projects may involve elements of Citizen Science, particularly when they aim to engage the public in scientific or <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> research (Ridge et al., 2021).</p>
<p>For instance, (Haklay, 2013) [pp. 115-116] distinguish four categories or levels of participation in Citizen Science projects, each serving as a rung on the ladder of public engagement. The levels are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1. <strong>Crowdsourcing</strong>:   In this level, citizens act as sensors and volunteered computing     resources.</li>
<li>Level 2. <strong>Distributed intelligence</strong>:   Here, citizens serve as basic interpreters and volunteered thinkers.</li>
<li>Level 3. <strong>Participatory science</strong>:   At this stage, citizens actively participate in problem definition     and data collection.</li>
<li>Level 4. <strong>Extreme Citizen Science</strong>:   In the highest level, citizens engage in collaborative science that     encompasses problem definition, data collection, and analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>When applied in the context of Citizen Humanities, public participation takes diverse forms. This involvement can encompass activities such as the public’s engagement in archaeological finds recording, as demonstrated by the Finnish Archaeological Finds Recording Linked Open Database (SuALT) project (Wessman et al., 2019). Another illustration is the case of the Citizen-Led Urban Environmental Restoration project where <em>‘young citizen scientists [in Jamaica and the United States] worked closely with museum scientists to restore two environmentally degraded urban sites’</em> (Commock &amp; Newell, 2023). In terms of crowdsourcing of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data or more broadly in the humanities, (Owens, 2013) [p. 121] discusses two primary challenges associated with integrating the concept. He highlights that both the terms and pose certain problems. Successful crowdsourcing initiatives in libraries, archives, and museums, as he notes, typically do not rely on extensive crowds, and they are far from resembling traditional labour outsourcing endeavours. Furthermore, Owens emphasises that the central focus of such initiatives is not on amassing large crowds but rather on cultivating engagement and participation among individuals in the public who have a genuine interest.</p>
<p>As Citizen Humanities broadens its scope to encompass a wider public engagement in <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> and <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> research, successful collaborations between <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> and relevant research infrastructures have shown promising results (Fišer &amp; Wuttke, 2018; Simpson et al., 2014). Furthermore, the integration of scientific and curatorial knowledge plays a pivotal role in <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> and humanities studies, uncovering previously unknown contextual information within original materials (France &amp; Toth, 2014). As illustrated by institutions like the National Library of Estonia, the shift towards human-centred approaches and the development of <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> services exemplify the expansion of Citizen Humanities (Andresoo, 2018).</p>
<p>Incorporating user-generated or user-enhanced metadata still presents several challenges (Raemy, 2021). One major challenge is ensuring the quality and consistency of the data. Another challenge is managing the large volume of data generated by users. With increasing numbers of participants and contributions, it can become difficult to process and organise the data in a way that is useful for research and for the broader public. As (Dahlgren &amp; Hansson, 2020) argue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Participatory metadata production has been valued for its potential to reduce the workload of the heritage institutions and make possible speedier digitization. However, in practice, little of the resulting metadata has been reinserted into the institutions databases and used in-house by information specialists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This challenge is compounded by the fact that user-generated metadata may be unstructured, making it more difficult to analyse and interpret. To address these challenges, it can be helpful to have a robust data curation strategy, maintained by a team that can communicate with participants on a regular basis, as well as tools and technologies that enable efficient data processing and analysis. <abbr title="Linked Open Data">LOD</abbr> can also be a useful approach for organising and linking diverse sources of information, enabling researchers to incorporate different perspectives and opinions into their analysis. This form of participation often involves micro-tasks, akin to ‘puzzle-like’ tasks, connecting users closely with the subjects they are describing (see Ridge, 2023). The dynamics of participatory projects are intriguing and multifaceted. As expressed by (Dahlgren &amp; Hansson, 2020):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[It] is the often tightly curated top–down design of crowdsourcing platforms where participation is wide in terms of numbers of participants but small in terms of what those participants are allowed to do. The second involves the preconception that the crowd per se, because of its sheer size, in some ways represents a diversity of perspectives and experiences, an idea which is often put forward as one of the benefits of participatory metadata production.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Five recommendations outlined by (Ridge et al., 2023), specifically geared towards the <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> domain, can serve as valuable guidance for various participatory endeavours. These recommendations encompass:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infrastructure</strong>:   ensuring platform sustainability by supporting existing tools     alongside new developments;</li>
<li><strong>Evidencing and Evaluation</strong>:   creating an evaluation toolkit to emphasise impact and wider     benefits;</li>
<li><strong>Skills and Competencies</strong>:   establishing a self-guided skills assessment tool and workshops for     upskilling;</li>
<li><strong><abbr title="Communites of Practice">CoP</abbr></strong>:   funding international knowledge-sharing events like informal     meetups, low-cost conferences, and peer review panels, ensuring     inclusivity beyond limited regional funding projects;</li>
<li><strong>Incorporating Emergent Technologies and Methods</strong>:   providing support for educational resources and workshops to     anticipate the opportunities and implications of emerging     technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>These recommendations offer a versatile framework that can be applied to various participatory efforts, transcending the boundaries of specific domains and promoting a more inclusive and effective approach to public engagement in research and collaborative initiatives. By adhering to these measures, Citizen Science projects can better flourish, fostering a collaborative and proficient community of practitioners. Rather than creating new infrastructure, research projects should leverage and extend existing ones, such as Zooniverse<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn91" id="fnref91">[91]</a></sup>, a generic Citizen Science portal and FromThePage<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn92" id="fnref92">[92]</a></sup>, a transcribing platform.</p>
<p>In summary, both Citizen Science and Citizen Humanities represent participatory methods of inquiry. While they have gained popularity, critical discussions regarding their potential limitations, notably in terms of diversity, are integral to their ongoing development. These critical discussions encompass issues like the challenge of addressing notions of volunteer — thus unpaid – labour, lack of diversity, and countering the dominance of traditional, often exclusive scientific practices (see Stengers &amp; Muecke, 2018). These conversations serve as essential drivers for the evolution of participatory approaches, prompting a reevaluation and refinement of their methodologies to ensure greater inclusivity and equity (Lewenstein, 2022).</p>
<h5 id="subsubsec:fair" tabindex="-1">3.3.2.3 FAIR Data Principles</h5>
<p>The <abbr title="Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable">FAIR</abbr> data principles<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn93" id="fnref93">[93]</a></sup> were developed to ensure that three types of entities – namely data, metadata, as well as infrastructures – are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. The four key principles of <abbr title="Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable">FAIR</abbr> and their underlying 15 sub-elements or facets are as follows (Wilkinson et al., 2016):</p>
<p><strong>F. Findable</strong> — (Meta)data should be easy to find for both humans and computers.     Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of     datasets and services.</p>
<ul>
<li>F1   (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and         <abbr title="Persistent Identifier">PID</abbr></li>
<li>F2   Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1)</li>
<li>F3   Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the         data they describe</li>
<li>F4   (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A. Accessible</strong> — Once the user finds the required data, she/he/they need to know how     they can be accessed, possibly including authentication and     authorisation.</p>
<ul>
<li>A1  (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a         standardised communications protocol
<ul>
<li>A1.1  The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable</li>
<li>A1.2  The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation             procedure, where necessary</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A2  Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer         available</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I. Interoperable</strong> — The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition,     the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for     analysis, storage, and processing.</p>
<ul>
<li>I1  (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly         applicable language for knowledge representation.</li>
<li>I2  (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow         <abbr title="Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable">FAIR</abbr>         principles</li>
<li>I3  (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>R. Reusable</strong> — The ultimate goal of <abbr title="Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable">FAIR</abbr> is to optimise the reuse of data. To     achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that     they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.</p>
<ul>
<li>R1  (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and         relevant attributes
<ul>
<li>R1.1  (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data             usage license</li>
<li>R1.2  (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance</li>
<li>R1.3  (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Originally introduced to improve data management and sharing in the life sciences, the <abbr title="Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable">FAIR</abbr> principles have evolved into a widely adopted framework that transcends research disciplines. They have been adopted in a wide range of fields, including astronomy (O’Toole &amp; Tocknell, 2022), genomics (Corpas et al., 2018), environmental science (Crystal-Ornelas et al., 2022) and the humanities. In particular, <abbr title="Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable">FAIR</abbr> principles have been applied to make historical archives, artworks or linguistic datasets more openly available for human users and search engines. Moreover, <abbr title="Cultural Heritage Institution">CHI</abbr>s have embraced <abbr title="Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable">FAIR</abbr> principles as guidelines and best practices, employing them in the deployment of repositories, virtual research environments or data platforms (Beretta, 2021; Hahnel &amp; Valen, 2020).</p>
<p>Yet, the concept of <abbr title="Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable">FAIR</abbr> data management practices in the humanities is not always straightforward as demonstrated by (Gualandi et al., 2022) at the University of Bologna in Italy. The study, involving 19 researchers from the Department of Classical Philology and Italian Studies were interviewed to investigate the concept of ‘data’ in the humanities, particularly in relation to the <abbr title="Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable">FAIR</abbr> principles. The study identified 13 types of research data based on participant input, such as publications, primary sources (manuscripts, artworks), digital representations of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> resources, but also websites, events, or standards. Thus, suggesting that within <abbr title="Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable">FAIR</abbr>, should encompass all inputs and outputs of humanities research. The research also emphasised the importance of methodologies and collaboration in managing research effectively, emphasising the need for clarity and consensus in applying <abbr title="Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable">FAIR</abbr> data principles within the field.</p>
<p>Indeed, implementing <abbr title="Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable">FAIR</abbr> can be complex due to the variety of data types and existing practices. Such complexity requires structured methods. As (Jacobsen et al., 2020, p. 11) point out, <abbr title="Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable">FAIR</abbr> is not a standard, it is a guide that needs implementations based on interpretations.</p>
<p>Similarly, (Dunning et al., 2017) [pp. 187-188] emphasise the multifaceted nature of the <abbr title="Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable">FAIR</abbr> Data Principles and the need to view compliance as an aspirational objective. Their research reveals challenges in achieving full compliance, with specific difficulty in the Interoperable and Re-usable facets. They advocate for basic policy implementation in areas like <abbr title="Persistent Identifier">PID</abbr>, metadata, licensing, and protocols, alongside transparent documentation. Additionally, the authors stress the importance of using <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure">HTTPS</abbr> – an extension of <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> (see <a href="#sub:webarchi">3.4.1</a>) – to ensure secure data transmission and accessibility. Finally, the authors stress the importance of collaboration between (data) archivists and researchers.</p>
<p>(GO FAIR, 2016) – an initiative that aims to implement the <abbr title="Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable">FAIR</abbr> data principles – outlined a seven-step <abbr title="Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable">FAIR</abbr>ification process, which includes essential stages in the transformation of data, as illustrated by <a href="#fig:fairification">Figure 3.11</a>. These steps begin with the retrieval of non-<abbr title="Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable">FAIR</abbr> data, followed by in-depth analysis to understand the content and structure of the data. The process then requires the creation of a semantic model that accurately defines the meaning and relationships of the data in a computational way, often involving the integration of existing ontologies and vocabularies. The fourth step involves linking data through the application of Semantic Web technologies, thereby improving interoperability and integration with disparate data sources. In addition, the assignment of a clear licence is highlighted as a separate step, emphasising its key role in enabling data reuse and open access. As a sixth step, metadata need to be assigned in order to support data discovery and access. Finally, the <abbr title="Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable">FAIR</abbr>ified data is deployed or published with its associated metadata and licence, ensuring that it can be accessed and discovered by search engines, even if authentication and authorisation requirements are in place. As a result, the new <abbr title="Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable">FAIR</abbr> dataset can now be more conveniently aggregated with other data sources, making it more straightforward to raise research questions across multiple sources.</p>

</figure>
<p>A further illustration of how <abbr title="Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable">FAIR</abbr> can be deployed is the conceptualisation of the <abbr title="FAIR Digital Object">FDO</abbr>, which includes a strong binding of various types of metadata (Schultes &amp; Wittenburg, 2019, pp. 7–9). The members of the (European Commission. Directorate General for Research and Innovation., 2018) [p. 35] underline that the establishment of a <abbr title="Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable">FAIR</abbr>-compliant ecosystem hinges on the <abbr title="FAIR Digital Object">FDO</abbr> concept, an implementation framework to develop scalable cross-disciplinary capabilities. As illustrated in <a href="#fig:fdo-model">Figure 3.12</a>, data must be assigned <abbr title="Persistent Identifier">PID</abbr>s and accompanied by detailed metadata to ensure reliable discoverability, usability and citation. They also argue to use widely accepted file formats and adhering to community-specific metadata standards as well as vocabularies to support interoperability and reuse.</p>

<p>(Soiland-Reyes et al., 2022) highlight the potential of <abbr title="Linked Open Data">LOD</abbr> to drive the adoption of <abbr title="FAIR Digital Object">FDO</abbr> within research infrastructures. While this approach provides specifications and tools, the proliferation of standards and metadata vocabularies poses challenges to interoperability and implementation. To address these hurdles, the authors present the use of <abbr title="Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable">FAIR</abbr> Signposting<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn94" id="fnref94">[94]</a></sup>, which enables straightforward navigation to core <abbr title="FAIR Digital Object">FDO</abbr> properties, without the need for complex content negotiation heuristics.</p>
<p>In summary, the <abbr title="Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable">FAIR</abbr> data principles comprise four key principles or 15 facets that provide a comprehensive framework for data management and sharing. While processes are in place to facilitate their implementation, the path to <abbr title="Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable">FAIR</abbr>ness can be complex, with interoperability and compliance challenges. A key element is the thoughtful mapping of different metadata standards and the strategic incorporation of Linked Data technologies. The <abbr title="FAIR Digital Object">FDO</abbr> approach is equally relevant to the <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> sector, supporting the preservation, accessibility and sharing of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data and resources. The sharing of code, accompanied by comprehensive documentation, also enhances such an ecosystem by facilitating the exchange of valuable technical knowledge and resources.</p>

<p>This chapter presents a comprehensive discussion where I interpret, analyse and critically examine my findings in relation to the thesis and the wider application of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr>. Through an in-depth analysis of the design principles of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> and their implications for <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>, this discussion aims to demonstrate the many challenges and opportunities inherent in this framework. The focus is on achieving community-driven consensus, rather than simply pursuing technological breakthrough.</p>
<p>The following sections are organised to provide a comprehensive review of the empirical findings, an evaluation abstracting <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr>, and a retrospective analysis of the research journey. Firstly, in <a href="#sec:empirical-findings">Section 9.1</a>, I will present a summary of the empirical findings from my research. This will include key themes and insights, structured to reflect the different areas of study and practice within <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr>.</p>

This evaluation will focus on the impact of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> on the perception of Linked Data within the <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> domain and the wider <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> field. This will include the key themes and insights that have emerged, structured in a way that reflects four levels of abstraction. I will also explore the dual nature of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> implementation, involving both simplicity and complexity, and discuss the various factors that influence such dynamics.</p>
<p>Finally, in <a href="#sec:retrospective-ant">Section 9.3</a>, I will offer a retrospective analysis of the research journey. This section will interpret the findings to situate <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> as fully-fledged actors. It will reflect on the challenges, achievements, and lessons learned throughout the research process, providing a holistic view of the project’s trajectory and its implications for the future of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr>.</p>
<h3 id="sec:empirical-findings" tabindex="-1">9.1 Empirical Findings</h3>
<p>This section summarises the empirical findings of my research and already offers some suggestions. The structure does not follow the exact order of the three empirical chapters but is organised around overarching topics that emerged throughout the study. The seven topics include Community Practices and Standards, Inclusion and Marginalised Groups, Maintenance and Community Engagement, Interoperability and Usability, Future Directions and Sustainability, Digital Materiality and Representation, as well as Challenges of Scaling and Implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Community Practices and Standards</strong></p>
<p><em>GitHub serves as a vital hub for community involvement, with a core group of active contributors often attending meetings regularly. This platform simplifies decision-making within the community, although it also reflects biases similar to those in <abbr title="Free/Libre and Open Source Software">FLOSS</abbr> communities. Behind visible activities like meetings, there is     substantial preparatory work managed by co-chairs, editorial boards, or driven by community-generated use cases. This foundational work often determines the direction and outcomes of formal gatherings. The LUX project at Yale, as seen in , has successfully fostered collaboration across various units, bringing together libraries and museums on a unified platform. The technological foundation of LUX, based on open standards, facilitates data integration and cross-collections discovery.</em></p>
<p><em>Not only does the deployment of <abbr title="Free/Libre and Open Source Software">FLOSS</abbr> tools contribute to these     achievements, but it also emphasises the social advantages of working collaboratively. The concept of the Tragedy of the Commons,     as described by (Hardin, 1968), highlights the potential for     individual self-interest to deplete shared resources. However, (Ostrom, 1990) offers a counterpoint by demonstrating how     communities can successfully manage common resources through     collective action and shared norms. In this context, initiatives like the <abbr title="Community Health Analytics in Open Source Software">CHAOSS</abbr> initiative<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn96" id="fnref96">[96]</a></sup> play a significant role by providing metrics that help evaluate the health and     sustainability of open source communities. These metrics include     contributions, issue resolution times, and community growth,     offering valuable insights into how collaborative efforts can be     maintained and improved.</em></p>
<p><em>Reaching consensus is another critical aspect of community practices     and standards. While the minutes of meetings are valuable artefacts,     they often reflect an Anglo-Saxon approach to decision-making     characterised by few substantive points and critical turning points.     The formal aspects of conversations captured in minutes do not fully     encompass the decision-making process, which frequently involves     informal conversations, consensus-building through open dialogue,     and subtle cues that influence outcomes. These elements are integral     to the English and American approach and hold valuable lessons for     an international community. <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art are international     communities, but decisions are made in English and the majority of     participants are based in North America and the UK, significantly     imprinting this approach. Understanding these nuances can help us     improve our collaborative efforts within the     <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and     Linked Art communities. By recognising and appreciating these     different facets of decision-making, we can learn from each other     and enhance our collective ability to make effective and inclusive     decisions.</em></p>
<p><em>Some of the challenges associated with these practices include the     major demand on resources for community building, the slowness     inherent in distributed development, and the difficulty in achieving     consensus. Additionally, the concept of social sustainability can be     seen as an imaginary construct that papers over differences, as     discussed by  Addressing these challenges     is crucial for the long-term success and effectiveness of the     <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and     Linked Art communities.</em></p>
<p><strong>Inclusion and Marginalised Groups</strong></p>
<p><em>The demographic homogeneity in these communities can perpetuate     biases and neglect issues relevant to underrepresented or     marginalised groups, as seen in . Participation in these     standardisation processes is itself a privilege. The assumption that     internet access and digital devices are universally available is     critically examined, revealing key actors in the digital landscape.     This mirrors issues within the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> community, where generating     <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> resources     presupposes means that may not be accessible to all.</em></p>
<p><em>We need clear terms of inclusion, as highlighted by      She argues that effective inclusion requires a     critical examination of the frameworks and conditions under which     inclusion is offered. The framework should ensure that inclusion     initiatives do not merely add diversity to existing power structures     but work to transform these structures fundamentally. This involves     questioning who defines the terms of inclusion, who benefits from     them, and who may be inadvertently excluded. (Hoffmann, 2021)     suggests a participatory approach, where marginalised communities     are actively involved in shaping inclusion policies and practices,     thus making inclusion an ongoing, reflective process rather than a     static goal.</em></p>
<p><em>The inclusion of marginalised groups is a necessary step, but it is     not sufficient. To truly make a difference, there must be a     strategic and concentrated effort to appropriate technologies, as     emphasised by     (Morales, 2009, 2017, 2018) and further     articulated by     (Martinez Demarco, 2019, 2023). This strategic approach highlights     the political significance of challenging dominant neoliberal and     consumerist perspectives on technology and individual engagement.</em></p>
<p><em>(Martinez Demarco, 2023) underscores the critical importance     of focusing on practices that go beyond mere inclusion. Instead, it     requires a deep understanding and critical assessment of how     technology is intertwined with social, economic, and ideological     contexts. It implies a reflective and deliberate process of     technology adoption in which individuals creatively tailor     technology to their specific needs, beliefs, and interests.     Moreover, a key aspect highlighted by (Martinez Demarco, 2023)     is the implicit and explicit critique of a universalist approach to     inclusion, which often lends itself to all too easy     instrumentalisation. Understanding and studying resistance to     inclusion in an oppressive digital transformation context is     paramount, particularly given the highly unequal conditions that     prevail.</em></p>
<p><em>In this light, a comprehensive study of socio-material and symbolic     processes, practices, and involved in embedding technologies into     individuals’ lives is needed. This approach also recognises     technology as a catalyst for change. It envisions the use of     technology to drive meaningful change at multiple dimensions and     realities—national, societal, or personal. By focusing on these     practices, empowering individuals to navigate and use technology     thoughtfully and purposefully becomes a reality, bridging the gap     between technological advances and societal progress     (Martinez Demarco, 2019).</em></p>
<p><strong>Maintenance and Community Engagement</strong></p>
<p><em>The tension between creating advanced specifications and their     practical implementation by platforms is evident in the IIIF     Cookbook recipes and Linked Art patterns, as discussed in <a href="#cha:social-fabrics">Chapter 6</a>. This     ongoing development shows that the community is still finding the     best ways to achieve broad adoption and interoperability. The     deployment of the Change Discovery <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>, as illustrated in <a href="#cha:pia-laboratory">Chapter 7</a>, demonstrates     that establishing such a protocol on top of the     <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr>     Presentation <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> is feasible and straightforward.     High-level support from leadership, particularly Susan Gibbons as     Vice Provost, has been crucial in building trust and ensuring the     project’s success as a valuable discovery layer at Yale. This     integration of diverse collections through a unified platform, based     on open standards, highlights the potential for transforming     teaching, learning, and research by leveraging collaborative     efforts. The topic modelling exercise in LUX reveals the intricate     actor-networks composed of organisations, individuals, and non-human     actors. This analysis underscores the importance of ongoing     processes and relationships in maintaining and evolving     infrastructure, akin to the concept of ‘infrastructuring’.</em></p>
<p><em>As detailed in <a href="#cha:lux-consistency">Chapter 8</a>, following best practices and guidelines such as the     <abbr title="Sustainable, Harvestable, Available, Reconciled, Enriched, Diverse">SHARED</abbr>     Principles is essential for better involvement, but it is also     crucial to uphold these commitments consistently over the long term     to ensure meaningful participation. Between the     <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr> team     members, there were sometimes <em>‘disconnects between different communities who undertake collaborative research’</em> (Vienni-Baptista et al., 2023).     This was something we had to navigate and learn from, which was     manageable within the context of a laboratory setting. However, for     any follow-up projects or whatever forms the digital infrastructure     we built may take, it is imperative that these disconnects are     addressed and solidified to ensure cohesive and sustained community     engagement.</em></p>
<p><strong>Interoperability and Usability</strong></p>
<p><em>Within <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr>,     different <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s     have been progressively deployed to meet various requirements while     allowing parallel exploration of data modelling. Each     <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> offers     unique advantages, but their collective integration promotes     semantic interoperability. For example, the     <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> Image     <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> has been     instrumental in rationalising image distribution across prototypes,     providing efficient access to high-quality digital surrogates and     the ability to resize them for different uses. Adherence to     <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> standards     and schemas within LUX has generally been positive, although     transitioning between versions of a specification can present     challenges, highlighting the need to improve the consistency of     compliant resources.</em></p>
<p><em>Linked Art, for instance, has the capacity to generate various     insights and sources of truth around different entities. However,     additional or entirely new vocabularies from sources like the Getty     may need to be used – such as Homosaurus. Complementary to Linked     Art, using <abbr title="Web Annotation Data Model">WADM</abbr> allows for assertions that go beyond     purely descriptive narratives, though it may sacrifice some semantic     richness. This complexity in managing vocabularies and maintaining     semantic richness directly ties into broader usability     considerations within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>Addressing these usability concerns, Robert Sanderson has suggested     focusing on the use of full <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s in Linked Art to ensure computational     usability, in contrast to <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr>‘s approach of minimising     <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s to enhance     readability. This difference highlights a fundamental question in     usability: balancing readability and computational usability.     Understanding developers’ perspectives on these approaches is     critical.</em></p>
<p><em>I would suggest as a way forward for the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art communities to focus     on further improving usability of the specifications. This includes     conducting comprehensive usability assessments of     <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s to evaluate     the experiences of new developers versus existing ones,     understanding the steepness of the learning curve associated with     each <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>, and     guiding improvements in documentation, on-boarding processes, and     overall developer support. Efforts should be made to lower the     barriers to entry for new developers by developing more intuitive     and user-friendly tutorials, providing example projects, and     creating a robust support community. Ensuring that developers can     quickly and effectively leverage <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s will foster greater adoption.     Addressing the challenges of transitioning between different     versions of specifications is critical, and developing tools and     guidelines that help maintain consistency across versions will     reduce friction and ensure smoother updates.</em></p>
<p><strong>Future Directions and Sustainability</strong></p>
<p><em>Survey findings, as discussed in , underscore the need for ongoing     efforts to develop <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> standards that foster an inclusive,     dynamic digital ecosystem. Future strategies should include creating     educational resources and frameworks that support interdisciplinary     collaboration and reduce barriers to participation. While the     Manifest serves as the fundamental unit within     <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr>, the     Linked Art protocol can play a similar central role as semantic     gateways in broader contexts, allowing round-tripping across the     <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s. The topic     modelling exercise in LUX, detailed in , reveals complex     actor-networks of organisations, individuals, and non-human actors,     providing insights into the relationships sustaining the LUX     initiative.</em></p>
<p><em>The next steps for Linked Art might involve forming a new consortium     independent of a <abbr title="ICOM International Committee for Documentation">CIDOC</abbr> Working Group, which could provide     the necessary support to sustain the initiative. Alternatively,     integrating Linked Art into <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> as a new <abbr title="Technical Specification Group">TSG</abbr> and specification could address the     discovery challenges within <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr>, as discussed during the birds of a     feather session led by Robert Sanderson (see Raemy, 2024) at     the 2024 <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr>     Conference in Los Angeles<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn97" id="fnref97">[97]</a></sup>. Design principles that act as     bridges across different disciplines, as proposed by     (Roke &amp; Tillman, 2022), are crucial. <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> has demonstrated that this     collaborative approach is feasible, and Linked Art could follow in     its footsteps. However, achieving this requires increased dedication     from passive members and broader adoption of the model and the     <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> ecosystem     in the near future.</em></p>
<p><strong>Digital Materiality and Representation</strong></p>
<p><em>As explored in <a href="#cha:pia-laboratory">Chapter 7</a>, the detailed digital representation of photographic     albums, such as the Kreis Family Collection, demonstrates the need     to comprehensively capture the materiality of digital objects. This     includes the structure and context of images, which are crucial for     maintaining their historical and social significance. The     implementation of the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> Presentation     <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> in creating     a detailed digital replica of the Getty’s Bayard Album shows how     digital materiality can be enhanced through thoughtful use of     technology, but also highlights the scalability challenges for such     detailed representations.</em></p>
<p><em>Creating these detailed digital representations can be seen as a ‘boutique’     approach, which, while labour-intensive and resource-demanding, is     necessary for preserving the integrity and contextual significance     of cultural heritage objects. The challenge lies in developing the     appropriate means and methodologies to achieve this level of detail     consistently. Future endeavours, whether through research projects     or collaborative efforts between <abbr title="Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums">GLAM</abbr> institutions and     <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr>     practitioners, should aim to address these challenges and create     sustainable practices for digital materiality and representation. As     Edwards aptly notes:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Presentational forms equally reflect specific intent in the use and value of the photographs they embed, to the extent that the objects that embed photographs are in many cases meaningless without their photographs; for instance, empty frames or albums. These objects are only invigorated when they are again in conjunction with the images with which they have a symbiotic relationship, for display functions not only make the thing itself visible but make it more visible in certain ways‘.
[(Edwards &amp; Hart, 2004) p. 11]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Challenges of Scaling and Implementation</strong></p>
<p><em>As seen in <a href="#cha:social-fabrics">Chapter 6</a>, the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> Cookbook recipes and Linked Art     patterns reflect the tension between creating advanced     specifications and their practical implementation. This gap between     ideation and real-world application underscores the challenges faced     by the community in achieving broad adoption and interoperability.     In <a href="#cha:pia-laboratory">Chapter 7</a>, the exploration of <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s like the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> Change Discovery     <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> illustrates     the practical challenges and potential of scaling these technologies     for wider adoption. The successful implementation in     <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr>     demonstrates viability, but also points to the need for continued     development and community engagement to fully realise the benefits.</em></p>
<p><em>Furthermore, assessing the scalability of     <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> image     servers, as discussed by (Duin, 2022) and exemplified by     the firm Q42 with their Edge-based service Micrio<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn98" id="fnref98">[98]</a></sup>, highlights     the importance of optimising data performance. Erwin Verbruggen     aptly noted that <em>‘optimising data performance in my opinion mens sending as little data over as needed’</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn99" id="fnref99">[99]</a></sup>, emphasising the need for efficient data     handling to enhance scalability. This insight reinforces the     necessity of continual refinement in scaling digital infrastructure     to support broader use and integration.</em></p>
<p>Reflecting on these findings, I would like to assert that continuous participation, particularly for institutions that can afford to be part of initiatives like <abbr title="IIIF Consortium">IIIF-C</abbr>, is essential. Active members should not only focus on their own use cases but also consider the needs and perspectives of other, perhaps marginalised, groups. Achieving the dual goals of making progress within one community, whether it be <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> or Linked Art, while also engaging in effective outreach and creating a solid baseline, will benefit everyone in the <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> sector and beyond. Addressing where <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> fits in, how people perceive this new concept or paradigm, and understanding how <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> differs from Linked Data in general are essential. These questions help to clarify the stages at which themes related to one of the <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> design principles emerge, crystallise, and potentially disappear. My thesis does not fully resolve these queries but offers insights and hints for further exploration.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the empirical findings reveal the richness of the implementation and maintenance of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> standards in the <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> domain. From the critical role of community practices and standards to the challenges of achieving interoperability and inclusivity, each theme underlines the complex interplay of social, technical and organisational factors. will look at the evaluation of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> and explore its overall impact, delving into the delta of what to do with it, particularly in terms of Linked Data versus <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr>, where my thesis provides pointers but does not provide definitive answers.</p>

<p>This chapter brings to a close the journey undertaken since February 2021, aiming to clearly articulate the answers to the research questions, discuss how the research aligns with the objectives, elucidate the significance of the work, outline its shortcomings, and suggest avenues for future research.</p>
<p>I had the privilege of hearing the above poem at EuropeanaTech in The Hague in October 2023. What struck me most, and what I have tried to convey in this thesis, was the powerful dialogue and collective spirit striving to harness the potential of our (digital) heritage. With a sense of conviction after this conference, I approached the next one in Geneva in February 2024 with confidence, believing that I had made a compelling case for the concept of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr>. When a participant asked how <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> differed from Linked Data, however, I found myself explaining the socio-technical ethos of <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art, the richness of the individuals who make them up, the ability to combine these different standards, and the common use cases that emerge from these collaborations. Whether my answer was convincing remains uncertain, but I knew it was too brief. Perhaps it is here, in this conclusion, that my thoughts can find their full expression.</p>
<p>I believe that <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> should be at the forefront of efforts to improve the accessibility and usability of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> data, an endeavour that is increasingly relevant in a web-centric environment. This paradigm has gained considerable traction, particularly with the advent of Linked Art and the recognition that the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> Presentation <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> has been an inspiration for the <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> design principles. The development and maintenance of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> standards by dedicated communities are characterised by collaboration, consensus building, and transparency. In the interstices of the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art communities, frameworks for interoperability are not only exposed, but revealed as profound testaments to the power of transparent collaboration across institutional boundaries. Both communities, it is true, are still very much Anglo-Saxon efforts, where the specifications have mainly been implemented in <abbr title="Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums">GLAM</abbr> and/or <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> research projects, or at least when we have been aware of them. It has clear guidelines on how to propose use cases, mostly using GitHub, and hides the sometimes unnecessary <abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr> complexity behind a set of <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data">JSON-LD</abbr> <code>@ context</code>. <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> is at the presentation layer and can really play its role as a mediator, with the Manifest as its central unit connecting other specifications, including semantic metadata, and preferably with simpatico specifications such as Linked Art.</p>
<p>An important hypothesis arises from the observation that adherence to the <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> design principles makes specifications more likely to be adopted. The primary benefit of adopting <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> standards lies in their grassroots nature. This grassroots approach not only aligns with the core values of openness and collaboration within the <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> community but also serves as a common denominator between <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> practitioners and <abbr title="Cultural Heritage Institution">CHI</abbr>s. This unique alignment fosters a sense of shared purpose and common ground. However, it’s essential to acknowledge that while <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> and its associated standards, including IIIF, hold immense promise, their limited recognition in the wider socio-technical ecosystem may currently hinder their full potential impact beyond the <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> domain.</p>
<p>Consideration of socio-technical requirements and the promotion of digital equity are essential to the development of specifications in line with the <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> design principles. In the context of the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art communities, this means both recognising current challenges and building on existing practices. This includes forming alliances that support diverse forms of inclusion at both project and individual levels. For example, organisations should be encouraged to send representatives from diverse professional and personal backgrounds, such as underrepresented groups or non-technical fields. This can be facilitated by initiatives that lower the barriers to participation, such as financial support for travel and participation, flexible participation formats, and targeted outreach efforts. Furthermore, as these standards often align with open government data initiatives, they present opportunities for broader public engagement and institutional transparency.</p>
<p>In the broader context of <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr>, understanding <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> involves tracing the historical development of the field and its evolving relationship with technology. The interdisciplinary nature of <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> has always integrated diverse scholarly and technical practices. In recent years, <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> has seen a notable increase in interest in the use of Linked Data and semantic technologies to improve the discoverability and accessibility of <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> collections. <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr>'s emphasis on user-centred design and usability aligns well with these goals. Consequently, the principles of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> hold great promise for advancing the integration and use of community-driven <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s and/or Linked Data within <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr>. This can be seen within <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr>, where the benefits of implementing <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> helped us to streamline machine-generated annotations, integrate different thumbnails into <abbr title="Graphical user interface">GUI</abbr> prototypes, model photo albums with different layers from the Kreis Family collection, and enable project members and students to engage in digital storytelling, an important participatory facet that can be seamlessly explored by <abbr title="Digital Humanities">DH</abbr> efforts and <abbr title="Cultural Heritage Institution">CHI</abbr>s with the help of the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> Image and Presentation <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s. Data reuse is definitely a key <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> driver, which could have been done more extensively with a productive instance of Linked Art. As for widening participation, this is definitely a strategic and political decision, rather than a technical one. That said, <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> specifications can definitely be embedded through strategic citizen science initiatives.</p>
<p>A recent example that highlights the comprehensive value of Linked Data was presented by (Newbury, 2024) at the <abbr title="Coalition for Networked Information">CNI</abbr> Spring 2024 Meeting. He delineated its significance as extending well beyond single entities, such as the Getty Research Institute, to enrich a vast ecosystem. Specifically, he identified three principal areas of value: Firstly, within the ecosystem itself, where the utility of information is amplified through its application in diverse contexts. Secondly, for the audience, by directly addressing user needs and facilitating various conceptual frameworks. And finally, within the community, by enabling wider use and adaptation of data and code. This approach to Linked Data, as articulated by Newbury, not only enhances its utility across these dimensions, but also aligns seamlessly with the <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> proposition, underscoring a shared vision for a digital space where the interconnectedness and accessibility of (meta)data serve as foundational principles for progress and community engagement.</p>
<p>LUX, as a catalyst for <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr>, exemplifies a practical approach to implementing Linked Data that has garnered significant local engagement and support at Yale. This initiative demonstrates how sound socio-technical practices can be effectively applied within a supportive institutional environment. The consistency of the data within LUX aligns well with <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art standards, with only a few minor adjustments required for full compliance. These quick fixes are manageable and do not detract from the overall robustness of the initiative. While it may be too early to fully assess the wider impact of using <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> specifications on the LUX platform within the <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr> domain, the initiative has already attracted considerable interest in recent months. This growing attention suggests that the LUX approach is resonating with other organisations, suggesting the potential for wider adoption and impact. The enthusiastic local engagement at Yale provides a strong foundation for LUX and highlights its potential to serve as a model for similar projects aimed at enriching digital heritage through effective collaboration and agreed-upon standards.</p>
<p>In carrying out this thesis, I have adhered to the five main objectives set out at the beginning of the PhD. These objectives have been accomplished to a high degree, reflecting a substantial and well-executed project. Furthermore, most of the outputs – such as data models and scripts – from this work are available on GitHub, providing open access to the wider community. In addition, I have published several papers, both individually and collaboratively, further disseminating the findings and contributions of this research.</p>
<p>Additionally, this thesis is relevant because it sheds light on communities and implementations that can be celebrated not only for their standards but also for their operating ethos; <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art present models ripe for emulation beyond their immediate digital confines. Here, agency and authority are most typically granted to the collective over the isolated, with each actor - be it an individual, an institution or an interface – intricately interconnected. Yale’s LUX initiative also embodies this ethos, demonstrating how collaborative efforts can lead to innovative solutions and wider impact. It is to be hoped, then, that these practices of openness and multiple partnerships will not be seen as limited to their origins in digital representation. At the very least, I hope that these socio-technical approaches can serve as exemplars or sources of inspiration in broader arenas, where the principles of mutual visibility and concerted action can point the way towards cohesive and adaptive collaborative architectures.</p>
<p>Despite its contribution, this thesis is far from perfect and certainly contains several shortcomings. I will name here three significant ones. First, the visualisations included and the use of <abbr title="First-order logic">FOL</abbr> are primarily designed to support my own self-reflection and may be more beneficial to me than to the broader academic community. While they provide insights into my research process and findings, their applicability and usefulness to others might be limited. Second, the theoretical framework I employed, while instrumental to my research, may not serve as a universally applicable toolbox. Nevertheless, I urge readers to pay close attention to <abbr title="Science and Technology Studies">STS</abbr> methodologies and practices. The works of Bruno Latour, Donna Haraway, and Susan Leigh Star have been invaluable companions throughout this dissertation. Additionally, for those involved in conceptualising semantic information, I recommend exploring Floridi’s <abbr title="Philosophy of Information">PI</abbr>, which offers profound insights into the nature and dynamics of information. These readings have greatly influenced my approach and understanding, and I believe they can offer valuable perspectives to others as well. Third, while the thesis aims to address both community practices and semantic interoperability, it leans more heavily towards the former. This emphasis on community practices may overshadow the broader discussion of semantic interoperability, potentially limiting the appeal of the thesis to those primarily interested in the technical aspects.</p>
<p>Other shortcomings include the broad scope of the thesis, with three empirical chapters exploring different avenues. While this comprehensive approach provides a broad understanding of the research topic, it has also resulted in a rather lengthy thesis. This may be a challenge for the reader, as a topic of interest in one chapter may not be as compelling in another. The diversity of empirical focus, while enriching the research, may dilute the coherence for some readers, making it more difficult to maintain a consistent engagement throughout the dissertation. Despite these limitations, I hope that the different perspectives and findings contribute to a richer, more nuanced understanding of <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> for <abbr title="Cultural Heritage">CH</abbr>.</p>
<p>Avenues for future research are numerous and promising. One interesting area to explore is the comparative benefits experienced by early adopters of <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art specifications versus those who implemented these standards later. Early adopters have the advantage of having their use cases discussed and resolved within the community, and it would be insightful to analyse the long-term impacts on their projects. Such a study is already feasible for early adopters of <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and will become possible to compare further implementations of Linked Art within a few years. Furthermore, future exploration could focus on the full implementation of Linked Art within <abbr title="Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives">PIA</abbr> or similar efforts, as well as more performance-oriented testing with the deployed <abbr title="Linked Open Usable Data">LOUD</abbr> <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s. These efforts should further validate the robustness and scalability of these specifications. Another important area for future investigation is the participation of institutions and individuals from the Global South in both the <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art communities. It is crucial to explore how we can better support their uptake of these specifications and encourage their active involvement in these initiatives to ensure a more inclusive and globally representative environment.</p>
<p>As I reflect on the journey of this thesis, I am reminded of the powerful dialogue and collective effort that has been at its heart. Mr Gee’s poem resonates deeply with my own aspirations for this work: to enhance our understanding of the past through openness and collaboration, as can be seen in <abbr title="International Image Interoperability Framework">IIIF</abbr> and Linked Art. As I bring this dissertation to a close, I am filled with a sense of accomplishment and a renewed commitment to promoting sound socio-technical practices. It is my hope that the insights and methodologies presented here will inspire others to engage in this ongoing dialogue, continually asking and answering the many questions that arise as we collectively explore our cultural heritage landscapes.</p>
